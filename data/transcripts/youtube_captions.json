    "transcript": "this is the build Tech stack Equity podcast we dive into the inspiring stories of underrepresented tech entrepreneurs and investors this episode is courtesy of Torro AI the number one recruiting firm for software development and AI Talent all right Kevin welcome to the show I appreciate you taking some time out to join us thank you thank you for having me absolutely so fund manager at sarak ventures before we get to that though I do want to learn a little bit more about you and talk about kind of your path I know you spent a bunch of time on the investment side but you know to give cont give folks context into who you are in your professional career would love for you to give us some background I'll give the high level first okay and then we can dig in deeper as you see fit I actually got my degree in civil engineering and I always like to tell people my path to becoming a venture capitalist was not traditional and I'm glad it wasn't because I learned so many different things along the way from an engineering perspective process order super helpful and understanding what I do now and then from there I went to become a financial advisor first at Northwestern Mutual and then second at Morgan Stanley learned a lot at different each of those locations and then from there I transitioned into the regulatory side I went to work for the Federal Reserve Bank while I was going back to school then I got into Venture and started at a seat stage firm here in Oklahoma City where I am and then worked on the lp side of venture at a venture capital fund of funds before deciding to launch my own Venture Capital fund SRA Ventures all of that happened over a course of 17 years so lots to pull apart there but that's the high level yeah so you know I think it's interesting even you mentioning you have a a non-traditional path to venture a ton of folks want to learn how do I get into Venture one way you know folks have taken the founder path had an exit decided to move in and on the fund manager side you were kind of you mentioned being a Federal Reserve correct and then transitioning into Venture so how does that actually I mean I understand it's still Finance of some sort but they're kind of two different worlds yeah I think what I've seen in my Venture Capital careers is that most people have these eclectic backgrounds whether they were a founder or they were an operator or they worked outside of the industry I've met a lot of attorneys who became VCS a lot of psychologists who became VCS people who were like poai or history whatever it might be I think ultimately what it boils down down to is are you able to Source good opportunities do you have a very curious mind and can you think about problems differently and then also probably the most important is are you able to actually invest one of the things that I feel like I've done a really good job of in my career is selecting Investments using a framework of how to think about the opportunity so whatever the medium was the medium just changed so if it was investing in a stock or real estate or whatever it was creating a disciplined approach to how you do that and then following that is the way to success I I think my first the interest of investing in general started 2005 is right after I graduated college right and a week after graduating I moved to Chicago had my first real job was getting my first real paycheck and I thought man you know what I didn't grow up with much money I need to do something responsible with this money so I started invested into I open up a brokerage account it's now Charles Schwab but at the time it was Scott Trade okay I just started buying I just started buying stocks of the companies I was using on a daily basis like I bought apple and sandis and CVS just stuff like that and said to myself okay each time I'm up a certain percent on a position I was going to sell that position and take my rewards no matter what was happening so I did that consistently over a couple of years and did pretty well and said to myself man you know what if I can develop this sort of investment strategy for myself and be successful at it maybe I can do that for other people and that's what got me on the path to wanting to get into finance and then there it was the same sort of decision making and strategy process with every single medium thereafter whether it was investing in Venture Capital funds investing in early stage companies I own investment properties so whatever it is just like deciding on a framework sticking to it and really that sort of way of thinking helps you as an investor and I think helps people to really think about oh if I'm G to get into VC or private Equity or whatever you got to be able to think like that right and so that first role you had as a VC or at the VC firm what did it look like I mean I know it can look various ways depending on where you are was it more hey let me go out and Source deals let me be the one that's fetting the deals let me kind of establish some sort of thematic approach to potential companies we look at curious what it looked like that first role you had within BC so the first firm I worked at was a organization called i2e which is short for Innovation to Enterprise and when I came there I had a role of being I called it a venture advisor which is kind of like a associate position and then I was also managing an in-house group of investors that they had put together that would co-invest with us into our deals and that was I was effectively the director of Angel Investments so I was managing that group and helping to Source deals for them but as a venture adviser it was the same thing the Mandate we had as an organization was to invest in Oklahoma based technology companies so that's what we were looking for with within that we invested in biotech companies and then just other technology companies I'm not an expert in life sciences or Healthcare so I didn't focus on those types of companies but all the rest of them I did did so it wasn't just sourcing them when we found them we were helping them with their financial modeling with their sort of operations finding Talent just sort of the standard things right but there was a lot of Hands-On work because these companies were very early stage right but you know so much of this stuff in Venture I think in just about business is just self-taught and if you have there's so much information out there now where if you want to learn how to invest there's very little barrier to entry to figure that out the hard part is actually getting the opportunity right but obtaining the information that's just something you control so I had been doing that for years studying the industry trying to figure out how to get into it and at the Federal Reserve part of what I took away from that role was we were we would go into these banking institutions and they would hand us a portion of their loan portfolio and we would sit down and go through each one of those companies and just figure out is this a good company that the bank actually made a loan to and it was through that process where I started to understand one how the money system worked and two how companies actually leveraged up how they operated and do did all these different things I never thought I would get that type of takeaway from working there but it was like cons it was like Consulting to a certain degree because you really had to understand what was happening in order to assess whether the bank was doing a good job of giving people money which in essence is not Venture it's more debt but it's the same sort of concept of are they validating this company well enough to give them Capital yeah and on the Venture side it's both debt and Equity but usually more Equity right yeah that's interesting because the experience I had and and I remember specifically moving from from Investment Banking and then over to the private Equity growth Equity side and you know on the investment banking side you're doing a lot of analysis but ultimately you're you are the advisor you are the middleman you're trying to get a transaction done when you move over to the buy side VC growth Equity PE the core question is this a good business right and so that leads to an entirely different way of thinking right which is what you reminded me of as your exp explaining your experience at the Federal Reserve you know looking at loan portfolios and saying is this a good business yeah absolutely so I mean I think early on in my career and younger people will ask me what do I need to do to move up in my career or get adventured and I'm like you know one there's no linear path in life in general I can talk more about the personal stuff if you want but I always tell people that the Epiphany I had when I was six months into my job at the FED which was challenging for me because I'm like super outgoing and that job is very analytical you're kind of isolated I was like I hate this job like why am I here why am I doing this then I heard this voice like this voice in my head that said you know wherever you are be there and I thought what does that mean the takeaway was it's like whatever you're doing try to add and also extract as much value from it as you possibly can because ultimately you're still working toward your goal but everything you're doing is one additional piece to the puzzle to help you achieve that bigger goal right so when I started thinking about my work in that perspective it's like okay what can I learn here that's going to prepare me for the future and that's when I started to get the value out of the role and out of the work and I've adopted that mentality with everything I do yeah no that's actually great because I mean you've got a lot of folks who are sitting in you know some sort of role and they may not be happy with the company the culture whatever and so you you make question like why am I here and then you kind of Disconnect but you know focusing on the bigger picture and thinking through all right well you know what value can I pull from this since I'm going to be here anyway any but you can either complain about it or actually embrace it and just dive in if you're a hiring manager and you appreciate the unique skill sets required to build AI Solutions then I would highly suggest you get your hands on our AI Talent salary guide as you know one of the greatest challenges in building AI products is acquiring the right team over 100 plus

efficiently once you explore our AI Talent acquisition strategies you'll never look at hiring the same way again links are in the description so so getting back to this question of what makes a good business or is this a good business I want to talk about your experience as an LP right sitting on the limited partner side and now you're thinking through how do I make investments into and you can tell me more where those dollars went to whether it be Venture private Equity hedge funds but would just kind of love to learn more about that experience because I think it is a side of the world we don't really necessarily get to dig into too much yeah you know and that was sort of an eyee opening thing for me but again going into that role it was about the Frameworks it was just a different one one level up versus sort of into the weeds I actually felt like it was a harder job for me and you would think it's not because it's less details but I wouldn't say it's less details it's just different details the decision is harder because the decision is that much more concentrated and once you make the decision there's absolutely nothing you can do about that decision thereafter and what I mean by that is this when you invest in a company it's likely that company is going to raise additional capital and as a VC your job the value ad is helping them with different things operationally such that if they need to tweak something or modify go to market strategy or add a different team member you can sort of help with that and if they need additional Capital you can say oh well we're not going to reinvest or we are right but when you invest in a venture capital fund it's a totally different type of analysis you want to meet the entire team you want to talk to the L portfolio companies you do reference checks with other people in the market there's so much stuff that goes into it and often the diligence takes longer because once you make that decision you're committed to fulfill whatever amount you said you were going to invest you got to fulfill that commitment over a usually three to five year period but you're locked in for until that fund terminates so going there for me I understood how funds operated but one of the things I loved and learned and sort of pulled from the experience was how do institutional investors make decisions and how do they analyze fund managers to who are the institutional investors in in the world that are doing this I got to meet a ton of those people and then also being on the front end of all the technology that was developed so for example as a VC you have to focus in a very specific specific vertical in order to be effective and help entrepreneurs with things that they need for us at sarak ventures fintech B2B SAS and like Commerce enablement Solutions but when you're investing in a fund they're also investing in a variety of different categories of technology so one of the fun things that I experienced at these annual meetings that I would go to is talking to all these different types of Founders building all these different types of Technologies it's always felt like was at the Forefront of so much technological advancement and you got to see it all it was that that was really fun in fact I miss going to some of those annual meetings to see how they did it and then hearing the perspectives of so many different Venture capitalists like really smart people who were running and leading these firms and you could get inside their minds of like the how they did what they did versus now you can do that but VCS are a bit more guarded when they're talking to other VCS than when they're talking to someone that could potentially invest in them so I think having that perspective has helped and also just visibility on so many different types of presentation decks and so many different nuances of if you're raising Capital who you should talk to and who you shouldn't talk to it has helped inform what I'm doing now at Sak Ventures but I think it made me a better fund manager because you learn at a very detailed level what it takes to actually operate and grow an Institutional level Venture Capital fund right right and and one thing I would love to get your perspective on is you mentioned who you should actually be talking to as someone who is raising a fund right so someone who has no experience actually going out and raising a fund you may just think whoever can write a check but like the world the universe of check writers can varies from Sovereign wealth funds to high net worth in individuals to um Pension funds and they all have different their own different criteria you know kind of how are there any things that you took away or that you could share that would be particularly helpful for folks who aren't as well versed in going out in fundraising if they're raising a fund right okay I'm about to I'm about to drop some gems on right now it's about to get real okay so let's just start with say foundations or endowments all right a foundation or endowment if they're a billion dollars or less they're going to work with an investment consultant like a Cambridge Associates or stepstone and I'm not dropping names because I know people there just giving you an example right well then you say okay so you reach out to the Chief investment officer at an endowment thinking that they're going to meet with you and they're going to look at your fund stuff no that's not going to that's not how it works the chief investment officer at an endowment or Foundation they Define the investment strategy but they rely on their investment consultant to actually Implement that strategy and vet opportunities for them most of the time investment Consultants have full discretion over how they're investing on behalf of their clients sometimes they don't now the challenging part with investment Consultants is they do everything on a platform so you have to get approved to be an approved manager on their platform and then once you're on that approved list as they bring on more clients that are looking for specific types of mandates whether it's early stage or private Equity or whatever it might be then they'll go to their list and say okay we're going to talk to this manager if you're not on that list good luck and getting on that list can take a long time and not only that staying on the list can be challenging as well because there's always new opportunities that are coming up so that's the one thing and I think many people beat their heads talking to either found foundations and theams that are too small or trying to if they get a meeting with an investment consultant they think that they're in I'm like no you're not and you got to get on the list and that's the hard part now for foundations and endowments that are greater than a billion they might have their own investment team internally and those are better because they don't have to use an investment consultant to make a decision so in those cases you're either going to reach out to the head of research director of Investments sometimes it's the CFO but in most cases it's never the chief investment officer a lot of people try to reach out to cios I'm like no they're so busy they don't have time to meet with a single manager they have a team of people that does that for them they're like a CEO of a company their goal their objective is to direct the strategy of the portfolio not necessarily to make individual Investments even though they can't they still have time to do it so that's Foundation endowments and investment cons Consultants so then you have sort of the next rung below that Pension funds right now as you know dar's Pension funds are huge right they also use investment Consultants but they're often so big if you're raising a small fund like mine it's just not even worth talking to them because their allocation amounts can be so large right most what would you consider small in the world of VC so a pension fund or endowment probably sub 100 million sub $100 million fund okay yeah definitely and that that's considered small to them maybe some of them are maybe 50 million but I would say for the most part sub 100 million is is too small they also have concentration limits as you know meaning that even if they do love your fund they cannot be more than 20% some cases 25% of your total fund size so that's another and then you have family offices which are great the challenge with family offices are is they're very difficult to identify to find who they are because they don't have like oh so and so family office some of them do but for the most part it's like llc's or corporations or it's just a company that the family owns and they just happen to invest on the side but they don't advertise they're not as formal as a investment consultant or traditional investment shop is now for the ones that are a little bit bigger here's what happens they'll hire a small team to help manage their portfolio that team might advertise and usually if their Investment Portfolio is successful they'll start trying to implement their investment strategy for other families that they know then they become a multif family office and it's the same sort of position they'll hire like a head of research they'll hire a CIO these are the people like the head of research like I I always look for that person because they're the Frontline person to determine whether or not your fund or fits their strategy so those that's who you go after not sometimes if they have principles or Associates maybe but that's usually not the case so that's endowments foundations and family offices and then the last one if you're raising a fund High net worth individuals the challenge with them is you really have to have a personal relationship with them many times they're investing in you and then your strategy so if people are fundraising in this sort of manner I always think about it from that perspective like concentric circles you have your high netw Works family offices endowments and Foundations and then at the end is the Pension funds that really big ones when I at my last role at the fund of funds we could invest across the Spectrum we were typically on that outer shell of the concentric Circle because we were large enough to work with pensions endowments and Foundations and then the high net wors were too small even if they wanted to invest but the one caveat with high net worths and I love High net worth I have several in my fund is that if they're not accustomed to investing in funds in general let alone Venture Capital funds they de they generally don't have the Firepower to support you over the course of three funds which is usually when you're going to see the performance start to show in that third fund interesting but the high wor they'll say oh you're raising Capital again it's been three years and I'm not seeing any returns then they're like I'm not going to invest anymore so then you have this hole in your fund rise that you have to fill when certainly you're glad they invested the first time but to have to replace investors it just makes it harder over time but you got to do what you gotta are there things that someone who's raising a first fund should consider compared to someone who may be on that second or third fund certainly that you know the good thing about raising a fund is you can have up to 100 100 investors in your fund and as a GP you have to be one of those investors so really you have 99 investors and I would say if you're if you have a certain fundrais Target you can either a I'd like to do something Charles Hudson suggested he creates this pyramid and at the base of the pyramid that's sort of like your bread and butter maybe smaller investors and that middle part and top part of the pyramid are your larger investors so when you segment that out you can sort of look at your network and look at how you're going to reach that end goal and start sort of blocking this off so when people ask you what's your minimum you say you can segment it well for individual investors it's this amount for family offices and others it's this amount and for larger investors it's this amount and when you do that it makes you look better better as a investment professional such that you're segmenting your strategy and it gives people like a menu of options to choose from and and makes you look more professional yeah so I definitely recommend and one other thing that I wanted to ask before we move on to sharak V you know thoughts on if you're raising your first fund thoughts on Fun Size right because you got you know folks who may want to come out and say hey let me raise a $200 million fund and we're going to vest like you know XYZ anything things that you have learned being on the lp side now GP around kind of first fun how folks should think about size as it relates to kind of probability of actually closing so there's two parts of this one if you have a track record and you know what you're doing and the Market's in your favor whatever you have a good probability of closing however if you say I'm going to raise a 200 million first time fund to invest in preed companies the size of your fund doesn't align with your investment strategy so for example at Sak we're investing in seed stage companies targeting a $30 million fundraise okay well the average seed Stage Company is Raising say $3 million kind of what we averaged but it's not that's the average and the valuations are X so if we're looking for a certain ownership and certain fund or fund raise amount then with a $30 million fund we can fill out a good number of portfolios to take advantage of the power law in what I mean by the power law as you know Darius is you want to have enough companies in the portfolio such that a few of them will drive the returns because the majority of them won't so in defining your fund size and your fund raise approach your fund size sort of defines a strategy but if someone like yourself who worked in private investment banking and you have all these connections and you're trying to invest in later stage companies maybe a 200 or $500 million first fund size makes sense because those initial checks that you're writing are 30 or $40 million MH I would think about it more systematically like that or if you're looking at REI companies and you're just trying to get started maybe your fund size is sub $10 million the fund size is not the issue is have you carefully thought about your strategy such that your fund size makes sense yeah I think what I've seen is the ambition to raise a huge fund off the top part of it because hey you want to get management fees to be able to you know hire folks to actually help out and then there are other reasons as well but there's also hey you could go raise a 20 million fund deploy capital and then go raise the next fund larger fund after you've proven an ability to kind of to execute um and so it doesn't have to be that you go for the Home Run uh right away you could build up to that yeah you know the fund size too as a GP most GP commit 1% to their fund so for that first fund when your management company has effectively if unless you just have money you have to figure out how you're going to pay that 1% for each investment that you make now there are ways that you can do that by GP notes and all those different things and should I explain what GP notes are do yeah yeah yeah that would be helpful I don't think most folks would would know about that so most people if they're raising say a $300 million fund don't have 1% of that just sitting around in a bank account so what they'll do is they will take out a note from the management company against what they owe in their GP commit and the that note will ACR interest over time but as the fund starts to make distributions back to LPS which technically as a GP you are an LP in the fund those distributions go toward paying down the note that you owe so you're effectively just sort of borrowing from the fund but relinquishing your distributions until that note is paid back and that's how people afford to do it because otherwise it's a he it's a big ass yeah absolutely okay great so I want to transition here and talk more about Sak Ventures lost Sak Ventures I think you just mentioned $30 million Target how do you think about we talked earlier about defining criteria for the types of companies that you want to invest in and so maybe an easy way to ask this question is if I'm a Founder how do I know what's the criteria and how do I know if I fit into sarra Ventures criteria so I try to think about criteria by way of alignment with what me and my team can actually deliver so I love Financial technology companies financial services companies because I worked in that sector for such a long time when we're talking about the nuances of how people navigate Building Solutions within that area I can actually add value there's so much stuff that occurs on a regulatory side on the goto Market side just customer behaviors I get that so that's one of the sectors we look at then I have another person who worked for large Enterprise companies he does a lot in that space and then someone else on the team is really good with B Toc companies so we look at that space as well so to the degree that we can add value we'll look at that from a sector wise if it's health care or Life Sciences I understand that space because I did had exposure to that when I was at i2e but it's not my specialty so I tend to not look at those types of companies or and you know we have a list of companies we won't do so that's the first thing the other thing that we look at is just general screening criteria of must have a finished product got to have cons consecutive months of growth in your Revenue we're currently primarily focusing on us-based companies even though we can invest internationally for right now we're focusing on the US we want to see a unified team ideally a diversely Le team like a minority or women L team that's not a requirement but it's something that we prefer so those are sort of a few of the initial checks and then beyond that as we're selecting and making the actual investment we're looking for deeper things like founder market fit is this the right founder in the right Market at the right time we're looking at is the market large enough such that they have the potential to continually grow into an expanding space business model longevity effectively does this team and the product have the ability to evolve as the market evolves one of the things I don't like are Point solution feature type companies where they're solving for a feature but not necessarily building the pic and shovels that a mult a multitude of companies are going to use such that they limit their growth see a ton of those types of companies and then the last one is I think I may have already talked about it but just product Market fit which are some of the standard things so that's sort of our sort of strategy at Sak Ventures and how we screen and then select but then down the line it's the value ad the value ad for us every company needs help with fundraising they need help with finding Talent they often need help with their goto Market strategy and we have I say perfected that but we provide a lot of Hands-On support in that area and to supplement what we do as a team we built this we call it our Guild it's a network of experts who help some companies with specific problems as they grow and I think that's the value that VCS bring it's not just the capital right and so can you talk a little bit more about the kind of the expert side because I can imagine folks you know whether it's a firsttime founder or they've had exits already right they may want to tap into some level of consultant who can help so functional experts in you said go to market hiring fundraising like how does a Founder actually kind of tap into how do they what does it look like to tap into that I think we are consultants and service providers I never said and I never will say I'm an expert in all of these different business functions that a company has but we should have access to the experts so for example just this morning before this call I was on the phone with a friend of mine who works at a tech company and I was talking to him about data security and data breach is and how Tech Founders should be thinking about that so I was talking to him about the internal mechanics of why this is such a big concern for companies and who are the service providers that help to solve these issues and he's one of the members of this Guild group and I was talking to a fintech company yesterday asking them about this specific problem that I was researching and he validated that yes that that's a problem here's how they should be thinking about this X Y or Z so the thing is in concept as a VC you have to have a network to fill the gaps of things you don't know and that's the because you're not going to know everything I mean that that would be impossible unless say you're focusing on one specific thing 100% of the time but most of the time Founders have a variet of different challenges that they're facing all the time yeah uh I want to get your perspective on the market as a whole so you know 2021 was a great year for folks who are raising but really quickly as we moved into 2022 kind of the funding Market dried up you know do you have any 2023 was rough and I imagine if you're any type of founder outside of maybe artificial intelligence right still uh a little bit Rocky here but want to get your thoughts on you know 2024 do you think that that uh we start to see more investment in the market I think that the transition to a better Market won't occur until the end of this year and into 2025 I hate to say that because everyone thought it was going to be like oh 2024 is going to be a great year yeah and it's still like I don't know but just looking at Trends in the data we had like the lowest fundraising for VC in general the lowest number of IPOs in general across like the last five or six seven years and the downstream effect is when institutional investors aren't receiving distributions they're not in most cases allocating to new managers and they're barely able to reup to existing fund managers so then what does that do that causes the VCS me and others to pause on making a tremendous amount of new Investments or deploying as quickly focusing on supporting existing companies so then new companies coming up the pipe they're left trying to figure out how do I get Capital to goow my business in the latest pitchbook report from q1 there were 55 companies raising money right now the capital to supply the capital to demand ratio was like one to two meaning that for every dollar that is out there there were like two or three people asking for it and they had a little note in there saying something to the effect of are there too many Founders in the market right now like maybe there are I don't know but everyone's sort of feeling the pullback of what's Happening Upstream in that when these larger pools of capital aren't receiving distributions it affects the whole line and it's just a cycle that we're in the last one occurred back in 2007 to 2000 then it was like a big boom but we're living in this era where we're coming out of this zerp era zero interest rate policy where Capital was just flowing freely and now that's not happening anymore IPOs aren't as frequent as they were anymore but couple that with what was already happening in that companies that maybe should IPO are staying private so much longer so there's all this like conflation of all these different things happening so I get it you know it's tough for fundraising it's tough for managers like me who are like starting out in in the market yeah but I understand it's just a cycle and once that cycle ends it'll be better I'm not saying it's going to be great but it'll be better and it'll be different what the climate like for specifically thinking about managers right like when you raise the fund you make this commitment hey we're going to deploy we're gonna you know deploy Capital within x amount of years right and then we're going to spend the rest of the time harvesting but you know you hit this moment where it's like okay well let's focus on our existing companies versus new Investments right is there pressure for GPS to deploy so that there isn't sold much dry powder I'm curious what the thoughts are there related to kind of dry powder but we also need to we also need to make you know the right bets there were I think there's about over $300 billion dollar of dry powder just sitting on the sidelines now going layer deeper the majority of that capital is resting with mega funds 500 million or more so it's skewed significantly to one side of the curve and that leaves a lot of the rest of the managers sort of thinking all right people think there's a lot of money out there but where that capital is needed the most it's not there I do think that this time that we're experiencing is forcing VC's back to fundamentals yeah of not investing in HP not investing quickly and not investing just because they have money to invest and more so taking their time encouraging portfolio companies to reduce their burn Etc and then also getting back to the philosophy our job is to return Capital to our investors within a 10-year time frame and maybe that goes to 12 years because of our extensions that we can put onto the fund you see the growth of the secondary funds coming to Market who are sort of taking full advantage of this opportunity to scoop up these later stage opportunities that are just getting long in the tooth because they've been sort of stagnating in these grow stage portfolios for so long and they won't go public so that's become uh a valuable exit strategy for some of these larger funds to provide liquidity to their investors but people thinking and Mark suster was just talking about this yesterday how IPOs shouldn't be relied upon for the liquidity that you need it's private Equity it's these secondary funds and VCS need to start thinking about this as a strategy to say look it's good to maybe you can get a five or 10x return on a company if you sell to a secondary or a private Equity maybe not that much maybe 3 to 5x but if you do that within a seven eight or nine year time frame that's better than waiting on like a 20x return the next 15 years which a lot of the funds will just keep extending yeah so I think that there's all that stuff happening right now and it's important as a fund manager just to be aware of that but I learned from my LP days that this is nothing new they should have been doing this already so it's kind of frustrating hear that oh this is a return like no this is what VC VC should be doing yeah which is interesting I know in my PE days we would specifically avoid we would call them kind of VC deals where the valuation was so high that as a PE firm probably not going to make the acquisition just because what we would have to pay is just Way Beyond any multiple that as a PE firm right but we're actually going to pay and so the VC because of how they structured the their initial investment now has tasked to rely on the IPO because maybe they were investing in hype right versus you know focusing on the fundamental as you mentioned yeah yeah I mean I don't think any sector is immune from when valuations get out of control I do feel like private Equity really did really well over the last 10 years because I don't think they ever really focused just on valuations and they to to maybe to the to their credit or to make things I would say easier they have a little bit more to evaluate whenever they're making an investment and they make fewer Investments so yeah I don't know if it's fair to compare the to but they're very similar yeah interesting so so I know we we're coming up on time here I do want to leave a bit of time you know we kind of crossed the cross the q1 Mark we're in Q2 now as of the recording but anything interesting coming up that you would like to announce for Sak Ventures whether that be you know something that LPS would would like to know Founders would like to know folks who want to become a a a investor at Sak Ventures but I want to open the floor for you you know I feel like when you're considering a investing in a new firm like mine I'm an experienced investor this is my first fund the first year of building an organization is the hardest especially in one of the toughest years in the industry arguably the toughest but but most of that building is done so we have hired a team we've made Investments our infrastructure we've had a first close we brought in a really important anchor investor so when it comes to like drisking a firm like ours that work has been done and now we're sort of hitting our full stride with settling into our investment strategy expanding the book all those different things so if investors are interested in talking to us happy to take that call also think maybe two Founders out there Founders out there as well happy to have those calls as well you know we every single Monday we go through every single founder that has applied to Sak Ventures and we respond to every single one of them it's either a pass it's a company we want to watch or it's a company we want to meet with and we think it's just our job to serve people and give them the courtesy of a response instead of them feeling like things get put into a black hole and maybe the last thing I'll say is if you're going to do something do it big and do it with purpose and that was the biggest reason why I wanted to start SCT Ventures as a minority investor especially in VC which I consider probably the least diverse industry that's out there we are an Open Door meaning that we've had doors shut on us primarily because of just where we were what we look like where we went to school whatever and I want Sak Ventures to be an organization that has an open door policy you know no matter what your ethnicity is or where you went to school where you live we are a firm that will give you the opportunity to make your case and I feel like that's important purpose that I've been called to with this organization and despite how challenging it is that motivates me every day to keep going yeah that that's awesome I love when when GPS can actually get in and talk about the firm because it it makes it makes Venture Capital more personal right Founders get to really understand that look you know kind of you guys are running the the same race in a lot of ways so uh but awesome Kevin I appreciate you taking some time out to share as much as you have with us and definitely you know best luck and we're going to make sure we stay in touch keep up with your progress perfect thank you so much for having me enjoy absolutely",
