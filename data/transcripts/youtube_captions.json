    "transcript": "I was at a dinner where where very smart uh VC who's done extremely well was talking about how he's worried that in the next handful of years that there won't be technology companies to invest in anymore because everything will be essentially like made as soon as you think of it or something yeah it's like it's like happen so fast I don't know I don't know if he's wrong what's up everyone welcome to the newest season of demo day the podcast where we bring in the top Venture capitalists and Founders to demystify the culture of the Venture ecosystem I'm Sean goldfan from coof ient labs and on today's episode we'll be interviewing Laur Grill General partner at jll spark from everyone here at coefficient Labs enjoy the [Music] episode I think that there's this weird perception that we're like all Mega wealthy and uh you know like we don't work and like you know there's like there's that perception that was my entire I had no idea how VC's had to raise money I thought everyone in VC was just ultra wealthy and I didn't realize that they go through a similar process as Founders it's harder actually I think it's much harder to raise Venture Capital funds than it is to raise for a company oh yeah that's like I just think that's way way way way more that's what eang was talking about was that like when you are a founder and you like you uh close down your business but like you put it you left it all in the field and then you like leave and you come back with your new idea you're almost looked at as like like oh the badge of honor like they like they they've done it whereas if you're a VC and you lose your first fund you are never going to get like follow on and so it's like you only have this one shot and you're not even directly like doing the thing that you want to do and I remember even in our last podcast you were talking about like being able to provide them the vision while also knowing that like you can't do the thing for them and there's this like juxa position between trying to guide someone but also not like get in their way and like it's it's really T are we recording yeah we are oh we are all right nice we are live this this actually like it's it's so funny cuz I always see all these podcasts it's like wait are we recording they're like yeah but that was great let's keep it great we're in we're in we're in um cool well I think this is a great way to start us off lauron thank you so much for joining us today on demo day uh this is a really special uh Edition for us we've had almost a year and a half off the demo Day show going through the you know the recession going through covid coming back into the studio and so there's no one that I'd rather spend it with with you kicking us off for our new season here so thank you so much man appreciate you and and and now in a blaze of fire unfortunately unfortunately in a in a very um really just sad you wouldn't know it when you're looking out the window which is crazy you really wouldn't yet we're we're filming here in Santa Monica we're a couple miles uh from the Palisades and yeah it's blue skies it's sunny but you know there's we were just talking before you came on the show about you know people are trying to think through innovative ways of getting money to you know people that are in need clothes um you know maybe you could even start us off like from your Vantage Point um the fires have had such an impact both on the Venture and and just founder side like what's that experience been like for you and for those that weren't in LA or didn't even get to like be a part of it what was kind of like the last week and a half two weeks like for you yeah I think that what has been really amazing and exciting and in a sort of Twisted ways is watching everyone come together um and you know if you talk about the specific Ally The Tech Community um you know I've seen many VCS many Founders uh we're all talking on our group chats unfortunately you know dozens of my friends and colleagues have lost their homes um many of which who have been on this podcast many of which you know obviously well um and it's it's devastating and there frankly there's not a lot you can say um other than just trying to be supportive and and uh roll up your sleeves and help wherever possible um but it's exciting to see um everyone coming together because I think that it's inspiring uh as far as my uh optimistic view of of our ability to to rebuild and we've seen uh you know just talk specifically about the VC and Tech Community where you know we put together a fun led by a handful of the leaders here in our space um to directly uh raise capital for people and invest in GoFundMe and and and directly impact uh the I mean tens of thousands of people who have who have been impacted by this fire and so um I think what's really interesting and I've been working in uh nonprofits for for two decades now and I was actually on the board of the Santa Monica Red Cross way back in the day so I saw a lot of disaster responses and and the um the challenges that come with the bureaucracy and things that frankly we often look at technology um to to try to solve uh and where we've come in the last 20 years is is pretty I think impressive I mean you you saw there was there was an app that that was Amplified pretty significantly called watch Duty which is a nonprofit app um that I think was uh vital to a lot of people's safety um and informing uh everyone about what's going on in real time it was it was just incredible to watch and and that is not a VC backed company right this is a nonprofit similar to like a Wikipedia type of thing um but I think that what this uh uh highlights is the the importance of leveraging technologies that are outside of our governmental organizations because there was a lot of mistakes for sure I don't want I'm not non-politically there was just a lot of um administrative uh uh issues that went into effect as far as the uh Warning Systems and you know the the response in general was was was not was not particularly uh fantastic and so how do we look at technology investing in certain applications and Technology whether it's software or Hardware um to support what seems to be a very common thing in this day and age which is natural disasters or any other sort of challenges that we face you know in humanity so without going too far into into a rabbit hole I'm actually you know will get into what I'm doing now but uh I'm seeing a lot of interesting Innovation and and uh um ways that technology can actually really positively impact our ability to um handle disasters like this and and and hopefully do better in the future yeah I mean I think that like you know we as like a culture have always you know even though we of course like never want such tragedy and heartache to come it seems like you know these big events really do bind and bring people together to it some extent and so you can see it happening at like the Grassroots Community level with like doing like uh clothing donations whether it's at like the Venture and funding level like putting monies together or it's using like technology to help um you know either like find ways to prevent it in the future or provide or or you know have ways of like limiting the damage and so I think it's really cool to see the technology the community coming together but you know I think what's lost for a lot of people um you know when you are not the person that's kind of experiencing that like major major loss it's easy to kind of feel empathy for them but um I want to almost bring bring it back to you luron and kind of in your own experiences everyone has that like one point in their life where they get kind of like so rocked and so sideswiped and they were so not expecting and you kind of get knocked down and like in those moments for you you know and I know everyone has different ways of dealing with like really tough times is there anything like you do in those moments when you're like walls closing in I can't believe this happened like what's your sort of default to I'm in a crisis and this is how I handle it to get my like my head my mental my physical like what do you do in the like most in intense you know experiences like this yeah um well I think without going to the extreme I've been you know extremely lucky to not have to deal with something quite of this nature I've had you know obviously loss in my life I think like most people have um uh I have an interesting reaction to uh we'll call it stress or um uh disorganization um I uh I often Focus heavily I I I I'm I'd say this is probably one of my better traits honestly is that my ability my friends would call it executive mode but my ability is when things are chaotic if I'm event planning and something's not going well or if I'm trying to um uh juggle a bunch of different things at once and and it feels like it's kind of losing control I find that I actually hyperfocus um and that's when I do my best work um and so you know kind of going to the extreme I've always been someone that feels very I'm almost way more productive when things are going poorly than I am when things are going well are you Inward and insular of like you go into a room kind of music on Focus or are you more someone that likes to whiteboard it out and kind of bring others into the it's a it's for me it's always been immediately like how do I get as many people involved as possible and organize it in the best way possible um I I again I think it's one of the things that I I would say is probably my best qualities I have a lot of bad ones but that's probably one of my best qualities um is I I I find that I do really really well when when uh there's a like bad situations it's very rare um probably a lack of sometimes of I probably should be a little more emotional about things but I I um I find that I I'm am far more uh um capable of accomplishing uh large tasks large goals whatever you want to call it when things are in flux um and so uh you know maybe that's maybe that's why I probably enjoyed Venture honestly um I think with Venture Capital which is a very interesting job is that you're not uh inundated with the same problem every day there's like a lot of different problems going on at once and you have to be you have to have good time management and understand where you need to be spending your time and helping your portfolio companies or dealing with your own administrative portfolio uh your own administrative issues when you're running the fund managing your team whatever it might be that's going on there's always a lot of moving Parts going on and I and I think that when things are at its like craziest at like full chaos um I find that that's actually when I do my best work um May I might attribute that to my like athletic days um I think being a goalkeeper in soccer like you're just you're you're constantly managing 10 other people on the field and you have to simultaneously behind behind behind well you're Sim exactly you're simultaneously trying to you know you're you're you're directing but you also Mak sure that you're doing your job and I think there's a lot of like leading from the back too a little B leading from the back yeah exactly and there's no glory in that which is actually an interesting thing right like I think that the correlations of the correlations of of being a goalkeeper in soccer is that when you win you did your job when you lose it's your fault you know it's like it's weird it's kind of a mess situation I've always had to like cope with which is you're not ever really going to it's very rare that you're the hero the only time you ever see the goalkeeper as the hero is they save a penalty kick to win a game right like that's kind of generally how you see what we live for yeah um which is like you know very rare few in bar between so ultimately like I had to over the many years of playing I had to uh develop that mentality that I think I've been able to uh apply to my to my job and to my life in general now you talked about like qualities like you've got great qualities you've got you know qualities you're not as proud of but just from the perspective of a Founder because you're really interesting in that like you built and grew your own company you've been a founder and you've also been a VC you've done early early VC stage and you've also done like a little bit later and like you're moving and have this experience for those that are just leaving school just getting their very first check in the door and they're starting the process of meeting VCS obviously just leaving school getting their first check as a founder or as a Founder like like like they're they're starting their very first company you know they they've come up with an idea they've got entrepreneurs coming out of college an entrepreneur and it doesn't have to be out of college it could just be like you know you're working at Intel you're working at Amazon you're working at some company and you decide I want to start my own thing entrepreneurs an entrepreneur and you start the process of kind of like building your list and thinking about who you want to meet when you're like in Mentor mode and it has nothing to do with you and your fund what are you telling Founders to look for what are the qualities that Founders should aspire to partner with in VCS well I think that look I'm now I've been doing this a decade and I've seen a lot of uh different approaches to um how VCS work um I used to think like you just want the person who's going to roll up their sleeves and you know be a co-founder or whatever you want to call it um I think it really depends on what you need uh I think everyone has their um different blind spots and the best Founders are the ones that identify with those blind spots spots are and then bring in Partners which is VC is a partner um bring in advisers right doesn't necessarily have to be a VC but they bring in people around their team that aren't necessarily core to the business um to fill the the the needs um and their blind spots uh and so I don't think there's a one side what I what I would say is that over the years I've learned that it's not necessarily that you want like one type of VC for every company you don't necessarily just want the person who is a startup Venture who like I need this to work I'm going to do everything I can to make this work those are great and there's a lot of solo GPS and micro funds and like smaller funds that are really impactful um at the earliest stages um however you know now that I've I was kind of I was that for five years right so I was like I need this to work I need to um I need to to be the champion for this startup and we've seen a lot of success uh from from some of our companies and I would say that you know me and and and my team really played a meaningful role in their early days to get them to those stages um that said they also needed different types of VCS to be successful right they you can't fill your your Advisory board or your invest your cap table with um uh a bunch of people like like me because ultimately in the grand scheme of things I was a small fish yeah right and so if you want to continue to grow and scale your business you're going to need to expand that uh that that that support behind you in order to leverage um the various different uh talents that come with that some of it is Network some of it is you know networking access some of it is frankly Capital you know there's just a variety of different things that are important so so you know you asked earlier like how can we start to evolve the podcast setting in a way where like it keeps evolving and and pushing the questions and for me a lot of it has to do with trying my best to like peel back layers of the onion from a strategic standpoint and so like if I was going to push back like one layer further and say like okay what's the next step like there's all these Founders they like are trying to move they're trying to build this product they think they figured out the problem but they have all these blind spots and they don't even know what they need they don't know like how do I know if I'm just joining an early you know VC like how do I know what type of Mentor or founder or VC relationship so like if you were just like Sean I want you to sit down like and start to either make a list like how do you figure out what you need at that early stage cuz it's like the most simple thing is I need money but then you get the money and there's all these other things you need so how do you like recommend that Founders self audit themselves so that they can find the right Partners I'll just take a like a specific case I think that if someone is looking to um if someone is looking to build out a company in the real estate technology space which is what I do now there are a handful of challenges that come with uh your ability to penetrate the the consumer base um and let's say you're like okay I'm I'm building a piece of software that is selling into um multif family uh apartment building landlords okay great you're that's that's fine the first thing you should do is validate that with multiple landlords all right so how do you do that right so the first thing is do you have access to them all right if you don't have access to them identify advisers who can help you so this is before you raise any Capital at all right you would identify advisors one one adviser will open up a door for maybe two or three more and so on so forth so you figure out a path to get someone to validate your idea not just with one type of of person right you're creating your your core customer um but ultimately you need to understand what the full Market looks like before you devote your next 5 to 10 years of your life in a lot of people's money toward it so I think the best way to look at it is validate right how do you validate early and who are the people that can help you validate it early and so that's like a very simple one it's like okay my blind spot is I think this is a problem or I've worked in this industry most of the time people some experience yeah most of the time people start companies because they've experienced it or they understand in some capacity but very often it still serves as your own individual perspective on it right if I go to uh someone who worked at a small brokerage versus someone who worked at jll they're going to have a potential a slightly different perspective on what are the needs or if you're a small landlord versus someone who's like gyar who's the largest multif family landlord in the country you know uh or property manager uh they're not landlords but if you go to these two different um uh uh groups ultimately you are going to get different responses right and so how do you get as many validation points as possible so that you can convince yourself that this is the right thing to do and I think that's like I'd say that's like bare bones that's like the very basic and then you kind of work from there cool I think that's that's really good advice not to you know I'll be jumping around a little bit here but I I do think it's really great to give like context of like when you and I first met um you were running the Luma launch program with Matt licker and like I had the chance to like see you in action with those teams and it it's like it's my favorite part of the startup ecosystem that like incubator accelerator like everyone's grinding in the same room together um but it's obviously like a lot different as you graduate out of those programs and you start to like go to series a and you kind of grow up a little and you start to build your team and so you've like been able to now live on like the earliest parts of like meeting Founders just idea aing and now with your transition into jll spark you have the chance to see like Founders that are a little bit deeper in their Journey so maybe just talk about like what's it been like to transition from the earliest stage first meeting first check to now having like where you are today with both access and just the types of people you're working with let's take a step back I should probably introduce what I'm doing now um so I'm a partner with jlll spark we're um uh the Strategic Venture fund backed by jll large uh commercial real estate brokerage Global Comm commercial real estate brokerage company um we have invested in a variety of different categories across the the CR commercial real estate space um ranging from sustain ability and construction technology and Property Management tools and um uh uh you know Robotics and we're kind of going down the list of the the very specifics fintech in the space um and we're looking at all of these various different vertical within our space and how we can both invest but also innovate alongside them and imp uh take these products to the best of our ability and uh not only use for ourselves but our clients and we've got obviously um hundreds of clients and so uh I've now been doing the corporate Venture experience and we're a unique corporate Venture in the sense that we we function autonomously in a lot of ways where we're able to actually take some risks and push our organization forward from a technology perspective and it it really puts us in a position um to identify the best talent so that we're uh you know not just beholden like like many business development firms um but we are a dedicated hundred million fir fund um we've invested over $400 million to date in uh 65 is companies I'm not sure exactly what the number is today but uh it's um it's been a a project that has shown uh we've had there's been a lot of ups and downs just because the industry is difficult but um what we've seen is that're we are really able to support a lot of these companies in a really meaningful way and you know the fact that we are coming in early in the grand scheme things what we're doing is series a a little bit of late seed a little bit of early series B so we're we're still extremely early for a company of our size we're a public company and the fact that we're writing meaningful checks 2 3 four five up to 10 million um means that we can not only participate uh in the development and the and support the these companies at the earliest stages to to be able to help them understand our industry even more and understand our needs and our clients needs and the industry as a whole needs but uh you know we're getting in early enough that we actually uh can can also uh experience the success as they you know continue to grow we've seen that in a handful of cases so I think what's and I I think the original question was the big difference um right yeah was it like how how is it feel to evolve through like you know again the the conversations are different when it's someone being like will you take a shot on me like no one else has versus like hey like this is our executive like once you're at least at today's series a it's a different um organiz it's like a different energy or at least I would imagine maybe it's not what is the what's the differences that you see between it's it's a Hu there's a huge difference but there's also a lot of similarities um you know I think that uh when I was writing you know a few hundred, checks versus writing three million dollar checks it there's bigger Stakes right like I it it doesn't the the the magnitude of the difference between uh what I was doing before and now does not get lost on me it's a it's it's every day I'm like wow you know like it's every time we write a check it's important um and we need to make sure that we're giving these these uh Founders the the best possible support we can in order to give our investment the best chance of success um but I will say one thing I've learned over the last four years because I'm now four years into into the jll spark is that there is not much of a difference in uh like the fundamentals the fundamentals of supporting frankly of just doing the deals but also the support is not that much different I just happen to be at a slightly different stage right so when you're preed the value of your uh investment and and mentorship and support in whatever way that you can is just as valuable at that time as it is at series a it's just a different check size and I always tell people when they're raising money um the raising a million dollars is just as hard as raising a $ hundred million you're just talking to different people right and it's the exact same thing from our perspective like it doesn't change the way that we support these these Investments whether we wrote a $300,000 check or a $3 million check now when it comes to that layer of you know the size and the quantity of dollars and cents I could imagine that like the line between if we want to invest or we don't want to invest like it can change very quickly because it's not like ah it's 50k who cares it's like once we make the investment and so you know at like the final one yard line obviously a lot I would imagine of your uh portfolio companies come through some warm introduction maybe cold as well to some extent but like once you get through that part what are the red flags at the one yard line that Founders often times are just blind spots they don't even realize that's the reason that they're getting a no when you're like talking to Founders and like most of the pieces of it look good on paper but there's something deep inside that's telling you like I don't think I want to move forward or I don't think we should have you found any patterns that tend to be like I made the right decision there or anything you can call out is like something for Founders to be aware of that you're watching you're noticing fundraising is a skill right I think there are certain so well I think that there are certain people that are incredibly good at fundraising and creating momentum it's not I hate when people say fomo even though that is sure I guess kind of a thing um I think that it's less about cre fomo I think it's creating uh being organized and creating a process to move things along because ultimately uh what I'm doing on the back end as a venture capitalist when I'm looking at a at a a potential investment is I'm trying to find the blind spot of myself right I'm looking at something and if I'm if I've gotten to a point where I'm excited about a deal my team's excited about a deal we try I I think I probably said this last time I'm always trying to find a no which is like kind of a weird way of looking at it I don't think everyone with this by the way but I'm always like how do I find the thing that makes me go to a no like how do I convince myself that I shouldn't do this deal so I've always taken that approach I think a lot of VCS take the positive approach where I'm like I'm trying to find a yes yeah and I'm not a I'm not a NE I wouldn't call myself a negative person frankly I don't think I'm a very pessimistic person um but I um I look at the the diligence process is where do I find my blind spot where do I find the thing that I'm missing that is like what is the reason why this is going to not work and then very often I find multiple reasons why I don't think it's going to work but that doesn't mean I won't do the deal it just means that I need to be aware of it so that we can weigh the pros and cons of all right here are the risks let me try to find as many of the risks as possible so when you're fundraising I think one of your jobs is trying to um illuminate those risks that you think I'll probably find and then almost like getting ahead of get ahead of it and say look I'm fully aware of here are the risks that that exist for our business for whatever reason um and and this is why we're going to achieve it because ultimately if I find those risks and you don't have a good response then it's generally a much harder uh saying that could be an indication of a red flag that's like oh wow the fact that they don't haven't thought about it or don't have an answer or response I would have thought they would have so understood yeah so I think just uh but but again part of that is just a very organized process making sure that you have your data room in in you know in check and the data room can depending on what stage of business you are is going to include a lot of different things um and so I I think getting ahead and being hyper organized and also driving a process like many Founders are very apathetic which is toly understandable especially if they've never really raised before where they're kind of just waiting and being like okay like hey like where are you guys at verse we're you know we're looking to close by this date what do you need from me all right here you know let's set up some meetings let's let's keep D like help me help you drive this process forward and then it's my job to say well I need more time doing this or I need to do this or I need to do that in our case um you know we're looking for uh alignment because we are a strategic Venture fund right and so uh this this industry has been obviously extremely commoditized in a lot of ways and people um will look at strategic Venture funds in different ways if they don't really understand how we work um I think there's a lot of bad examples of corporate Venture funds um no specific examples but there are a lot of examples where I don't think corpor Venture funds has really been all that effective but I think we've done a really great job of um building a platform that we are preemptively identifying how we can be supportive and vice versa how is this startup going to support us and our clients as well and I think that when you have that Synergy it creates a lot more success um but we also have a team uh you know I have four or five people on my team that are dedicated specifically to supporting no no no no just supporting the portfolio company with our with our parent business and with our industry after we've invested so when we make an investment it's not as simple as just me sitting on your board you're getting me you're getting one of our growth principles who's dedicated to being a liaison for helping you penetrate the market um and I think that is a requirement in order to be really successful and so we're able to do a lot of this ahead of time this is my long-winded way of saying that when we're in the diligence process we're able to put you through the paces and it's not about like we need to have a you know six-month pilot and like we moved very fast it's not necessarily that it's more that we're just doing a lot of the work ahead of time to make sure that when we make an investment we're not going to be dead weight on the cap table yeah yeah yeah now when it comes you know you mentioned before that you know uh you don't necessarily think of yourself as pessimistic but I uh I was talking to Howard Co over at Morpheus and I said Howard oh my God I was like Howard do you have any questions that I should like ask guests that you know you think is like you know a good question to ask is he pessimistic or optimistic I don't know it goes both ways I love Howard yeah yeah I I think that's a good yeah he could be dead in the middle but um you know he said something like you know everyone's always talking about the upside of AI like like what are you excited about and he's like ask you know ask what they're worried about like so my question to you is what are you worried about with AI uh I know this is a big jump from Founders but I'm just curious in general like forgetting the upsides of how it could impct prop Tech how could impact our society what are the downsides or some of the things you're just worried about I think the biggest thing that I'm worried about is just data security I think that cyber security component of it is a little bit terrifying what does that mean to you well I mean like I I've heard I'm not an AI expert and I'm not going to pretend to be one um so you know we're investing in this space and we've uh I think we've made some really good investments in the AI space specifically around what we do um but uh I I think about like as agents become more um I don't want I don't necessarily say autonomous but as they become more uh part of dayto day powerful I'm I was trying to look for a word that that is not too ominous but whatever um as the the the the as these llms continue to improve um as you have more players that are you know continuing to train and essentially build these out whether it's Google or you go go down the list of you know the open AIS and um and andity and all all the likes um my my biggest concern is the self-awareness component and you know goal oriented AI agents will often have shown to often do whatever they they need to do to get to the goal yeah uh and so you know I I don't know I've heard some like crazy stuff like I mean think about just like Banks your money like your money is not sitting in a room your money is electronic um encryption is could become obsolete uh there's there's because you're saying he I could crack encryption or like super computer yeah a matter of seconds um and so how do we compete with that right what do we do when you can no longer keep bad Agents from penetrating the things that are court or are are Society Society yeah yeah and that's like I'm talking like the financial institutions okay but what about our like utility grids right you know like what there's a whole list of other that don't have the best CTO or like the best infrastructure of like security and things like that yeah and so and what about I mean in our case we're we we actually look at um cyber security protection including AI but a variety of other things um cyber security protection um uh around smart buildings right we have a lot of buildings that are running on software now that whether it's your elevator systems your HVAC systems your your security access control all of these uh uh products are technically hackable right and so there's this hu and then you have sensors I mean I'm looking around here I don't think you guys anything but no sensors in here yeah but but you have in many buildings you have multiple sensors and you have all of these things that are techn like technology that's connected um which also means that that connection can be hacked if that connection can be hacked you know with AI can only accelerate that process so how that I'd say that's what keeps me thinking yeah a lot of people will talk about like jobs and stuff and I think that's a huge part of it I'm actually less concerned about that because I think with every technology advancement we've always created jobs around them and I'm very hopeful that that'll be the case I'm more concerned with the cyber security component do you feel like you know I think it depends on the industry but is AI just like taking over every conversation you're in you know I was showing some another VC you know the product that we built here at coefficient Labs with our ugc videos and I remember you and I sitting at dinner at you know what was that place called The Wallflower and you were like early like this is years ago you were saying about how like you know we need to start to like get the AI agents and like this could all be automated and I'm talking to someone yesterday and he said like if if you came to me in a year regardless of your growth or how much revenue and like you don't have ai as part of this flow like each space I just like wouldn't be interested excited because I know there's people that are chomping is is that how you feel the whole ecosystem is that like every company needs to have it I I haven't seen uh I haven't seen an investment that we were interested in doing that didn't have an AI component yeah now I think what's I think what's an important distinction is that um AI is very at this point is like very similar to saying I have a website like a Kleenex right yeah um no no what I'm getting at is like it's foundational to any technology company moving forward I was at a dinner where where very smart uh VC who's done extremely well was talking about how he's worried that in the next handful of years that there won't be technology companies to invest in anymore because everything will be essentially like made as soon as you think of it or something yeah it's like it's like it happened so fast I don't know I it was a little bit it was a little bit scary but I don't know if he's wrong I mean I I think it'll be I think it'll be interesting to see see what happens like what does like a tech company look like when you don't necessarily yeah customer support is all Ai and that ties into customer success and it's like you just have strung together teams you strung together a bunch of apis to be able to build a a startup so it's like is that what is what is the future of technology look like I think is a very big question yeah that I'm not nearly smart enough to answer do you care I mean I know you care about it but like is it like is there a means to that end of like or does it just you end up going into these like Circles of you know like does it even matter do you spend time thinking about that we need more General Contractors we need more people who who build with their hands yeah robots aren't quite I mean we robots can do these things but it's not it's not cost effective yet so um I think if you're I think if you're someone coming out like look build a build a general contracting company that's you know leveraging all of the best Technologies and you'll do just fine um I hate to say it but in La we're going to need a lot of general contractors over the next few years right no I I'm I'm kind of joking but I'm not you know I think that I think that technology is is at an interesting place right now I think we're at a at a um at a juncture that is could go a handful of different ways um your original question was will I look at or something about Ai and I just think that like yeah AI is is fundamental to any technology company at this point none of the companies that we're investing in frankly 95% or 98% of VCS are investing in are foundational AI businesses right like very few of us are investing in the um large llm like the you know the ones that we see on the in the in the newspaper and a lot frankly a lot of them are coming from the big companies right it's Microsoft it's Google it's it's these large it's Facebook and so on it's these large public companies that have the infrastructure have the money have the capabilities to support what is uh required essentially to compete in this space um and so and I'm not saying there aren't other companies doing it but it's just that the amount of money that's going into it so what we're investing in is the application right very again very similar to like the people who created the worldwide web right the the actual like Foundation of the worldwide web is one thing but there were a lot of websites that were created and on those websites they were leveraging uh the worldwide web to be able to uh you know essentially build businesses and I think right now we're at that phase where there's a lot of AI applications um and some are better than others and uh hopefully you know these applications will be able to build sustainable businesses going forward and we'll see yeah now I want to jump back to the Venture like the corporate Venture because I think that there's obviously a lot of people that know what corporate Venture is but for those that don't know what it is they sort of have only heard of the main you know this VC fund or that VC could you just explain a little bit more like what is a corporate Venture fund and why would someone in the prop Tech space like get value from being a part of your fund versus some name or some VC they've heard of that you know does all the big unicorns like what is so special about a corporate Venture fund that maybe you know people don't know about I think that not all cvc's are created equal so I would be very uh I I try I think one of the challenges that we face is we try to um create our own unique pocket in the in the world of CVC and say look like J spark we have a track record we've been doing this since JL uh since uh 2018 and uh we we hang our hats on the fact that you know I feel like we we operate very differently than many cbc's in the sense that we align our goals right our goal is to build help you build your business we're a minority investor Our intention is not to AC acquire the companies that we invest in um our goal is to support you and be the best possible strategic partner to validate your product to help you understand um how to sell your product to our space to uh you know help you identify blind spots I've said multiple times where where you know I think there's a lot of assumptions that are made when someone is making a startup and they're saying well of course someone's going to want this well let me help you identify why someone might not want it you might not actually think about this um and so we do our best to be great Partners um to help you get a venture outcome because ultimately our goal as the GPS and my team is to not just return Capital to jll but return Capital at a you know at a multiple a significant multiple while while simultaneously helping the company well being strategic right the only reason we're doing this for what it's worth the only reason that jll has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in this is to identify companies that are going to give us a a a better insight and an edge from a technology perspective to uh compete in the market you know we're we have competitors out there that are um you know do they have their own technology uh road maps and they have their own perspectives on them and uh and and we believe that ours is the best and and jll Technologies is a is an organization within jll that is purely dedicated to uh supporting technology in the real estate space specifically at jll we are a offshoot of jlll Technologies and so um I think what we're doing is is really Innovative and uh and different you know some people might say otherwise they might not know but I think if you talk to our portfolio founder yeah if you talk to our I won't say that but if you talk to our portfol Founders I think you'll find that the vast majority of them have have really uh achieved you know a lot of success by partnering with us and so when you ask why would you go with us over someone big I actually don't necessarily think it's about that it's we like to work alongside other Venture capitalists our again our goal is not to be an acquirer our goal is not to own this information our goal is to be a partner in this so that we can all kind of rise the tide rise the tide and so I I'd say that something something that I've always I mean again I've been doing this a long time and I did this with Luma I could never do it alone right I could never be successful by being the only investor well I have the same approach with jlll spark we're always looking to partner we've invested in other Venture funds in our space where we're very close with I've done multiple co-investments with tons of other prop Tech funds um as well as a lot of other traditional funds um and uh I find that our relationships are always really really Dynamic and successful because we're strategic I actually think it's like because we live in our own like you know uh um uh verticalized World our ability to partner and work with other Venture capitals is a lot more um synergistic because we're not really competition you know we're there to we're there to help the on and grow and push up exactly now we obviously have our own you know we take board seats and we we'll lead rounds and we will do these things but we're I wouldn't say that we're the most sharp elbowed group when you like look back at your growth as a VC from Luma now to jll like you know obviously it's not necessarily A regret because like everything that's happened to you has gotten you to where you are now but when you have time to reflect backwards like what's a weakness or blind spot that like you now see had you had worked on earlier in your career 10 20 years into it you would be in a better spot and I'm just asking mostly for like again the up incomers that maybe have blind spots that they're just like oh I never thought thought about that or I didn't think that was important is there anything that you've learned that's really important about being a VC that you just really wish you had paid more attention to at the very beginning of your career yeah I don't think it's necessar I'm not going to necessarily say something I wish I paid more attention to but what I would say I learned is that track record is something that takes a very long time um I think that you know it's funny you know when I was first starting off I was like oh I have a track record after a couple years it's like not really right you know and now I'm 10 years and I'm like I have a track record and I look and I go not really you know I've invested in I don't even know uh a lot of companies um 60 70 something I don't know but um I don't have a track record and I've had you know some success um moderate success but I'm I'm like wow this is this this takes a really long time and everyone I talked to when I was first starting was like this is a long game and this is not a game you get rich quick I can assure you and we were talking about this like VC's most often at least the the smaller VCS are like hustling just like every other founder they don't necessarily come from a ton of money um not everyone is wealthy that goes into VC it's just it's kind of a different path of of being a Founder um and it's a it's a really difficult path in a lot of ways um again this is not across the board there are obviously examples that are otherwise but um this is you know I'm grinding as much as I possibly can to get the success that a Founder is looking to get uh and so I think just the mentality of how long it truly takes to be successful in this is uh you got to be prepared for it you know and and uh as I said I'm 10 years in and I'm like man this this really does take a long time and I look at my portfolio and I'm like yeah these companies are doing well what the heck now now granted the last four years haven't been great right I think um it's it's we we took a little bit of a back a step back um from an exit perspective an IPO perspective and so timing wise I wouldn't say I was IDE [Music] uh but you know I think this is the the reality of things moving forward I don't think this is a uh this correction isn't a temporary thing I think this is just yeah and it's frankly it's what it should be that's what I was going to ask is like what do you think you know and it sounds like you've already kind of answered it with the hustle and the grip but like what's needed in today's world to be a successful VC in today's world because when you and I last talked it was 2019 we were about to go into covid there was that Hu you know of course like uh retail uh went to [ __ ] but like s like everything was like growing and exploding and there were VCS popping up in every fre you know it it was just like it was just so much and now like a lot of the VCS like you've seen a bunch of VCS that were like Tik Tock star VCS no longer VCS and like you know it's just like it's evolved and it's changed like what do you think is needed over these next 2 three years is anything at all needed to stay on top of the game or do you still think there's going to be a lot of movement happening you know that's kind of what I'm what I sort of was alluding to before is the value of a strategic VC I think is key and doesn't necessarily mean a CBC there's a lot of uh Venture capitalists that have focuses that have built networks that have um uh sort of built their thesis around a specific uh category and I think that in a world where um it's this industry has become so incred L commoditized which is Venture Capital where you have everyone in their you know in their mom are trying to start a fund uh or saying that let me repas it a lot of people say they're Venture capitalists and have to be careful right there's a lot of people that have money yeah there's a lot of people that have money I'm an invest or whatever um but they don't actually have money and I think that's a big challenge in it makes it makes it really hard for Founders because they don't know who they're talking to fraudsters yeah there's so much out there and so and I've even heard it on the flip side too like I was chatting with uh VC that we both know I won't name him but he was saying that like with where like the crypto industry is right now that he has people that he's invested in that kind of go off the grid and like it's later on he's like oh they [ __ ] made hundreds of thousands of like like he feels like he's getting kind of scammed to some extent because like there's just a lot of fraudsters right now crypto is a whole another ball game and we don't need to go down that rabbit hole but um I I think that what we are doing in in terms of our ability to position ourselves strategically in the market will is the correct way of of whether it's through CVC or raising strategic Capital it could be either right so there's raising capital and and identifying a space and trying to bring your LPS into a space there's a handful of these funds out there that have done this that I think can you can be very successful if you're also you know you can't just be a strategic you also have to be a really strong VC and actually do all the intangibles but at least it gives you I think an edge vers generalist I think look there are some amazing generalist investors out there who many who have been on your your fun I just think starting a new one is very difficult um and so you know if you've EST like what's the I think there a like why is it difficult and what's the misconception that the Earth like you know the people that are like oh I'm just going to start like what's the misconception or what's so hard about getting it going or raising capital is just the beginning deploying capital is the challenge so if you're a generalist that's trying to build a name for yourself and you're just and you don't have some kind of unique approach and there's a handful of unique approaches some people are looking more Venture Studio types some people are looking more strategic there's ways that you can carve out niches within niches you know whatever you want to call it um that'll at least give you an edge in in um breaking through some of the noise when founders are looking I mean ultimately when a Founder is looking a great founder is looking to raise Capital they're very often deciding between the investors they want to take capital from so they're making a decision of who do I want to partner with me it's not who will invest like who's willing to invest in me there's a portion of that and there's a lot of people that are like that but there's also a good portion of of Founders and often the ones that are uh some of the upper echelon are vetting the VCS and if you're someone that doesn't have a clear perspective on a very specific Niche where you can bring a unique value that others can't or at least very few can um I I just think that's where the challenge is so you might be able to you might have a great Network you might have a great personality you might have a good story you might have a good track record and so you're able to raise a capital how do you convert that into actually deploying n years out and like them not even nine years out in the first three years how do you deploy Capital how do you get you know being big on social media is not enough these days there's a lot of people on social media um it's just it's not there's so the problem is there's so much Capital now and so you know creating a niche or creating a um uh a a sort of your your individualized value proposition is not an easy thing to do and at so for instance at jlll spark we are we have a it's built into our our thesis like it's very clear where we present value it's very clear where you know where we can provide um a a sort of a strategic partnership that goes alongside our investment and so we don't really struggle with that which is great now go back to Luma launch if I was starting Luma launch today I think I would struggle a lot in 2015 when we were building that uh you were like one of few and there was like very few preed investors here you had a handful of you had the sick office space we had a great office we held great you know we had workshops and events pingpong tourament ping pong tour no but it was it was unique to the time and it was it was early enough that we were we again it was I I think I alluded to this I was small fish in the grand scheme of things but we were big fish in a small pond because there was a handful of people that have been here for a handful of years but there weren't a lot of venture funds and then you saw between 2015 and 2020 that just exploded and now from 2020 to 2025 it's even more yeah even more which I love and I'm super excited and as I said like you know when we're seeing this community come together with these wildfires you like I'm on these these group chats with with other um uh GPS around La and it's like God it's so cool to see where we've come and not only just the success of the The Venture funds and the startups and stuff that are in LA but how I think a lot of people were uh Curious what was going to happen as La grew and our Venture funds grew were we going to become San Francisco and become like that super sharp no offense to San Francisco sure sure we all know what's up there um where it becomes a lot more sharp El less Community less tight tight-knit our community in La has gotten tighter for sure I mean look there's obviously like competition for dollars and Deals and yada yada but when it's all said and done we're all one really strong community and I and I love that and I think it's what makes La Tech and La VC and and and and this just general um uh ecosystem really special because I don't think you see that in New York or um or or San Francisco or some of these other cities speaking of I'm curious if you'll answer this do you have any hot take on La Tech week this past year like I don't know hot take like like the reason for me at least it felt like this was the third year Tech week and like year one was so Grassroots feeling and there was like you know only like 12 events or 20 events or whatever and then the next year was like okay it's like building and now it's like every single well this year was like there was like 2,000 events throughout the city and like you know whereas like we would see I would see you at every single event then it was like oh yeah like there's just too many to go to it just felt like everyone was using it as this example I'm just curious if you like if you feel like that's good for the ecosystem if you feel like it's like moving away from the essence and it's becoming almost like meme coinfi not to go back into crypto I'll throw it back to you but like what is the essence of what La Tech week was well to me at least it was CU I mean again it was it was it was spearheaded and it is spearheaded very smart very smart very smart yeah they've done they've done a fabulous job of of doing that you know the reality is um I don't think anyone uh ever really did a good job of of pulling everyone together like the whole Community together and so like power to what they did I think was great um I think what you know with the LA team Andrew and Kata and all of that group they' done and Derek and so on um I think it's I think it's awesome um to to answer your question directly do I like this year for instance yeah it feels a little saturated I I think what I think what would be I mean I don't know I'm not going I'm not the one running it so I'm not going to to get too far into this but I think what would be good is some kind of consolidation we saw a little bit of it where like certain people were coming together to try to do events together so it wasn't like I was going to a bonfire event a Crosscut event you know every and up being the same people and the same conversations and like what's the point of that that's also that's a good point of it too yeah I think for me it was more maybe like like emotional or no it's like oh yeah like everyone's together look at like for me at least it's like oh all my all the people are together and so I think it felt maybe it was just a very personal thing of like oh I get to see everyone like in their Zone whereas this year it was like so spread out and we were also running around like trying to capture content but I was curious like if you feel like it's good for the ecosystem of like again just like the awareness the top of funnel of it all or if it's sort of just like it brings a lot of people here um I think that's great I think um it showcases uh tons of of amazing things that we're doing here that go beyond the VCS because honestly there's nothing special about the VCS so it's ultimately it's like what are the companies and the the industries that are growing here and so I'd love like a larger emphasis on like maybe categorization of like and highlighting one or two events per vertical and like really trying to invest our I think collect what would be great is collecting the resources together to do a bigger singular events for all of these different things the problem is that everyone is trying to get their name out there get theirs yeah yeah for sure get theirs um and like we did an event last year with Bap and I love yeah last year was best food you guys had for sure yeah we were at proper was it navitar I forget there was it was a group of us and um and it was nice it was great you know and it was and we had I think a good panel but like look and we didn't do something this year and and it was I kind of looked at that and I go I don't want to just be another event I don't want to just it doesn't need to be more sounded like that was the like water tower didn't do wi this for the same reason though it was just like water tower did one this year this year yeah really yeah they had a they had like a a like fireside chat wow Derek not cool man I'm just kidding I think I think it was this year it might have been last year honestly I I could be well yeah last year they did the they did The Bungalow um no no no no needless to say needless to say um well you know luron I think you know as we start to come to a wrap on the episode today I like you know very been an hour yeah we're we're we're jamming right now dude I feel like The Joe Rogan show like it's been 3 hours yeah no totally and and I think like that was actually kind of leads me in your mind like is there anything that you're just like excited about talking about right now is there anything that you've been jamming with friends on or topics that you think should be like put out into the ecosystem like anything that's on your mind that you think is just like you know good for people to think about or consume I think the biggest thing on my mind right now is what's going on with these fires um I and and not from a a nonprofit perspective for sure I think that you know it's it's super important what the immediate response is I think long term from a technology from a real estate perspective um my industry obviously is going to be a massive um uh force uh to to not only uh support the the rebuilding process of Los Angeles but the reality is I mentioned before is we're seeing disasters all around the world and they seem to amplifying right and I don't want to get into climate change doesn't matter the point is we're getting a lot of these you know you're seeing massive snow storms in New Orleans in Florida it's like okay well Florida yeah there's like there's there's a lot of stuff that we're going to have to face moving forward when it comes to the way that we build infrastructure and I um you know historically we've invested in a handful of construction technology companies in order to uh create more efficiencies but I also think separately it's how do we think about applying material technology and applying build processes and applying and applying um various different uh uh protection mechanisms in order to combat this this massive change in our environment um which you know I I I think technology is going to be a huge part of how we do that and so it's going to be a lot of Hardware stuff which I think many people are a little bit uncomfortable with but you know how we rebuild what type of materials are we using um you know how do we like detection systems I think drones will be really interesting like I always think about this like at what point are we going to have a strong drone system to be able to combat fires right now obviously when the one here was a whole another ball game when it came to the winds so I don't think drones would have would have done would have done anything but there's a lot of situations where it's not as much of a of an issue and as as drones become bigger and more capable of handling payloads like I feel like we could do some really systematic things with that right um so I don't know I again I'm this is not my area of expertise when it comes to fire suppression but it has your focus right now but it's more that it's what it's what I'm thinking about it's like how can we invest in uh a future that is taking into account that these things are real and and what are the the companies that are going to be built because of them as a VC I think that you have to not think about the problems necessarily purely today but what is the problem that's going to exist in 5 10 and 15 years away um and and so there's going to be a lot of ancillary businesses that are uh that are that are needed in order to support what the future of a lot of these um uh these challenges that I just mentioned so that's what I would say is really interesting to me and it happens to be something that we look at again construction Tech sustainability technology a lot of these categories that are core to what we do at jlll spark I think is really um I'm glad that's what we do in a lot of ways and some of the things that we're looking at because it gives us the ability to invest in meaningful impactful uh uh companies so cool man well guys if you're listening from home and you want to learn more about lauron

    "transcript": "If the person that I'm investing in doesn't ask for a reference from me, that's a really bad sign. There are a lot of in our industry. I mean, for one of my companies, they just raised a series A. Part of that A- round was to take out an existing investor. That was a huge negative force on the company and a massive energy drain on the founder. It was terrible, man. It was such a negative founders out there like due diligence on your investors prior to taking money from them. What's up, everyone? Welcome to another episode of Demo Day, the podcast for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists where we demystify the culture of joining one of the top accelerators, incubators or VC funds from around the world. I'm your host Sean Goldbound from Coefficient Labs and on today's episode we interview Jeff Bokean from Okopy Ventures. Without further ado, let's get into demo day. [Music] Jeff, thank you so much for joining us today on Demo Day. Yeah, I'm psyched to be here, Sean. Thanks so much. So, Jeeoff, one of my, you know, favorite things about our last conversation was, uh, you know, listening to sort of your core key values of yourself and the, you know, things that you mentioned that were so important to you was number one, lead by example, and number two, have a positive attitude. And uh having known you now for a couple years, you know, you just you emanate that positive attitude. Jen came in the room and I was like, \"God, Jeff's a really nice guy.\" And I just want to say it's really great to have you here. We appreciate you and I'm excited for today's episode. Thank you. Well, I uh appreciate that and I love the positive attitude. It's a mantra of mine even within my family. Yeah, it's pretty fun. I have uh four kids and my youngest uh there was a stretch one summer where or last summer we ran out of like things to do for the summer with like scheduled camps or whatever. So we had camp daddy one week and that's cool. Tell me more about that. Yeah. Well, it was fun. Well, we did all kinds of like things with with my kid for the week and uh where I took a lot of time off and my uh some of my older kids helped out. But we made camp t-shirts and positive attitude. We wrote that was the camp that was the camp motto. Cam positivity. Yeah. So around the neck of the shirt it said positive attitude and then the back of the shirt said start with yes which is our another family motto. We lean forward, lean into things, start with yes. Yeah. I love it. So let's let's peel the onion back a little because I think that you know um sometimes people, especially myself included, the quote unquote like positivity, the optimism almost like you know it's just like who I am who you are in that way. But, you know, I'm sure you and I both have had moments of hardship. We've had moments where it's like, I don't want to be positive and I don't feel like everything's great and you have tragedies like, you know, the Palisades fires. You have all of these, you know, roadblocks that hit you in the face. And so, you know, keeping that as a steady beat of the drum is something that you have to work on. It it's it's like a muscle that you're, you know, growing. Why is it important just in life to have a yes first attitude, to have a positive first attitude? What can people that maybe that doesn't come as natural to them understand that maybe they don't see? I mean, not that I've got it all figured out, but I think that when you start with yes, you are open to all the possibilities and at least have a very open mind about uh what can happen. So, obviously in the venture capital space or in entrepreneurship, you know, you're looking to create new opportunities. That's how big businesses and uh are created is when you are finding an opportunity that others haven't seen yet. So if you're kind of leaning back, arms crossed, you're kind of I'm not so sure, you don't see the doors that are actually probably open that in front of you. Uh so you you need to start with that. Um it's it's kind of ironic in venture that you know I start with yes, but I say no 99.99% of the time, which is a little frustrating to me actually. Uh but you know because I look at a thousand deals a month and I'll do like maybe one. So, but I always to take to start reading the uh you know the pitch or to engage with a founder, you have to start leaning in and you have to start with the belief and then maybe from there you're knocking it down like well why doesn't this work? But you have to start with like what are all the possibilities what can really happen and I think it's just critical for founders to always when you are have that positive view that you can find windows and angles that others are maybe not seeing and you can go for it. Now, you know, you were talking about how it's a staple for you to teach this to your children, keep it within the family, let them know about it. A lot of people don't have those parents that are like, you know, so, you know, confident in the opportunities of the world. In fact, so many are more like you shouldn't do that or you can't do that. Is that something that came from your parents? And is that natural to you that it's always been that way or is it something that over time you're like this is how I want to do it and I want to pass this down to my family? Yeah, that's interesting. I uh I don't know if it was for my parents so much or they encouraged me to take risks and try things and try new things and gave me a lot of flexibility and rope but I think for me it was um I things have worked out quite well for me without I followed kind of a weird path and it wasn't pre uh it wasn't all set up for me you know I kind of didn't go through things in a planned sequential way I was kind of open to opportunities and and things worked out I mean I even got into venture capital kind of on accident. I I wasn't trying to be a VC. Yeah. You were trying to get a job at a startup in London. Right. Right. Right. And then it turned into a venture capital job. So, but but it's like I things like that have worked out when you're open to opportunities and and you know being positive. And to be honest, people like interacting with other positive people. And you know, business, especially venture capital, but even just within business, it it's a uh people get to self- select who they want to work with, who they want to hire. And people want to be around other positive people. And I think it just it it creates more opportunities for you when you are more positive. Yeah. Aside from seeing the opportunities, like people want to pull you in. They want that positive energy. And it's a plus. I I don't know, to be honest. I'm not that like uh intentional about it, I guess. Um as much as you know, I just try to be that way. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think that's a a good segue cuz I never really got that to ask you this in our last conversation, but like what's a normal week like? You know, what's a normal week like both for Jeff individually and you know, maybe for people that are like what the hell do venture capitalists do every week? How would you describe a typical week as a VC and maybe even in your personal world? Yeah, so I spend largely it's broken into thirds. Okay. Spend about a third of my time working with our existing portfolio companies. So I'm on the board of a lot of different companies that we've invested in. Um, and whether it's board meetings formally or just trying to help uh make a uh business introduction uh with a customer for one of our portfolio companies for somebody doing helping interview uh a potential senior manager for um one of the roles in one of our portfolio companies like I I will do that sort of stuff every day. Um or interacting with fellow investors um who are in invested in the company. am I drive up here today? Like that's a whole car ride was talking to fellow investors in one of our portfolio. You're welcome. You're welcome. I knew you I knew you needed to catch up with everyone. Make the time. So a third is on portfolio. A third is looking at new deals. Okay. And um maybe a little bit more than that actually, but at least a third where I'm looking at new opportunities, whether it's getting formally pitched by founders, just reading through uh decks that I'm getting access to. And then the other third is a combo of generating deal flow. So meeting with people like you to uh or fellow VCs or other entrepreneurs who maybe they don't have an active opportunity, but I'm just spending time with them because I'm I think all right, hey, here's somebody who's really connected. Someday they might introduce something great to me. Yeah. So this generating deal flow in that last third and you know it's like attending parties and events or whatever it may be, you know, in the entrepreneurial community. um or just texting with people. Hey, you know, what have you looked at recently that's exciting? What should I be investing in? Um and uh then spending time with some of that networking is actually with investors too. So investors for myself. So like our money doesn't like I don't have a money tree in my backyard. I wish I did, but like I need to raise money too. It's it's generally generally more episodic where we raise every 3 to four years. But um in those fundraising years, I'm spending a lot of time you meeting with investors trying to get them to invest into our new funds. What's one thing you've learned over the years about maintaining those sorts of relationships? Later in the podcast, I want to ask a little bit more about what you look for in LPS, right? Not just in startups, but in those sorts of relationships, but you know, when it comes to maintaining those sorts of relationships, what's been something you've learned over the years that's helped you down the road? you know, maybe early in your career it wasn't so clear, but now that you've you've been in it, what's a learning you've taken away in just the concept of maintaining relationships? Yeah, that frequency really matters. So, you know, you can have a great relationship with somebody and then if you don't talk to them for 3 years, then you ping them out of the blue again. Like, it's yes, you can often pick up where you left off, but I think it's better to have like lots of little touches along the way. So that's another thing I try to be somewhat more deliberate about when we get some really great portfolio news for example like I will forward it with a personal note to all of my investors saying hey this happened and then it gives a chance to dialogue about something else and if I do that at least twice a year of course we do a newsletter but that goes out to everybody and it's not personalized but if I have a chance to have a personal touch point or maybe it's just a text message and it can even be about like oh I know this person is a Philadelphia Eagles fan like I'm going to text them congrats in the Super win or whatever it is. But those little touch points really matter. And I I think that's probably the most important thing that I found. Now, quantity over quality sometimes. Some people listening may be like, \"Well, yeah, Jeeoff, obviously you should keep in touch and you should be frequent, but how do you do it? Sometimes I forget or sometimes like it's just not top of mind.\" Um, they may be wondering like what's your methodology? like it come natural and you're just like, \"Oh, I should have hit this person up.\" Or do you have to schedule time for yourself or kind of remind yourself to sit down? What would your actual uh methodology be when it comes to those quick little pings or those frequency touch points? I mean, to be honest, I probably should schedule it more and be more deliberate about it. Um it's more authentic just like you you it's almost like a feeling of oh I should hit this person up or talk to them or if I'm in there at the city or if I'm traveling around or something happens like I I try to you know be open to reminding people like hey I'm in town I mean last night like I was up in the bass area which I'm not up there too often. Yeah. And I pinged a guy who you know I'm is a longtime friend who uh I've done stuff with over time and um I was like oh yeah I should ping ping this person you So sometimes when I'm in town it it's a little bit more um serendipitous but which isn't a great strategy. No, totally. I always be open to that. But for me, like the formal way of doing it is just when I people love getting good news and especially people that have backed you like our investors like they're they're not only backing me but they they like to hear about the portfolio companies and it's a long game like they can put in capital with us and they don't they often don't see it for like if they put in a million bucks with us they may not get that money like get the beginnings of returning that capital for five, six, seven years. Wow. And then by the time they fully are out of the fund, it could be 10 to 12 years. So it's a long game. So you need to uh kind of keep people warm and reminded that of why they made the investment and how things are going. Giving good news is always the most fun, but sometimes we have to give bad news. And so from the perspective of both founders listening to this that are, you know, maybe the quarter's been rough, maybe they had to let someone go or they left and got recruited out, but what's the right way or what's a a spectrum of right that you want to see from founders when bad news needs to be delivered? In your opinion, is there a difference between the right way to do it and the wrong way to do it? Well, the wrong way to do it is is wait and and delay bad news. I mean, honestly, that I'd mentioned that car ride up. That car ride was because the founder had not updated people in 5 months and there wasn't great news along the way. And people suspect that because people fill the void of not hearing good news, they're assuming the worst. And then then things start to spiral out of control. They get a lack of confidence in the management team, which that kind of compounds itself down the line. It's going to it's going to be harder for this founder should he need to go back and raise more money. The existing investors aren't going to be dying to give it to him because now like they have this the seeds of doubt like well sewed at this point like I'm not so sure about this guy and then when I've reached out to him to see how things are going he's kind of not really getting back to me or getting back with nothing much. So I'm assuming the worst. So I I I think it's best to pull bad news forward early and not necessarily to spin it as like oh this is bad but everything's going to be great. I think it let deliver the bad news and then say what you're doing about it and even if you don't know what you're going to do about it is going to be right at least lay out a plan. U but I think you know letting people know early and then laying out the game plan for how you're going to address it and then say I'm going to check back in with you couple you know two three months later and let you know how we've been doing and if we're on track to getting things back where we need to be. But I think that you know laying it out there early with a clear plan is is key. laying out early, have a clear plan, check in frequently with postcommunication, like those three thing combo when you've got some back and then asking for help. Honestly, I think that's a big part of it, too. It's like, hey, I've run into this problem. Like, we're struggling here. This is my plan. Give me some feedback. If if you think that's right, or if you think you can help me execute this plan, let me know. Wow, that's a great extra piece of advice because then if you're giving the bad news early enough, then you're able to almost like empower people to help you early in that journey to write the ship. But if you deliver it at the very end, it's like, dude, why didn't you come and talk to me a couple months ago about it? Yeah. I mean, look, the the startup process is a a whole collaborative process. I mean from the beginning yes you are receiving money from investors but like they are standing beside you with their it may be with their checkbook but a lot of people are willing to help beyond that as well. So they want to they are you know backing those teams more than just with the money and it's even an emotional investment too like they've you know they're they're in there with you. So they want to be able to help so sharing in the pain and you know helping people get through it if they can. What market trends are you excited about right now, if any at all? And I I'm also curious like with a a preliminary follow-up question, which is like is it tough for you to allow yourself to get excited about industries outside of your wheelhouse? You know, it's sort of like if if like you love startups and investing, but it's your job dayto-day. Um what are you excited about these days? And does it fit within, you know, what you're currently doing or has that been a an obstacle over time? I've been super excited about what's happening with AI, of course, people going to talk about AI, but what I like most about AI as a seed investor is that our we don't have to put a huge amount of money into companies to see if there we can get some real traction early. So the AI tools are just making startups more efficient. So I think that ultimately it's going to allow us to take have more shots on goal at successes and so sometimes we will write one or two checks into a company we may not even really feel like we've figured out if they've gotten there yet and we've the companies have had to consume a fair amount of capital to get to that point. I think we're pulling forward is their product market fit sooner with the AI tools because you're not having to invest so much capital and time to get to that point. So I'm really excited about that. So we can test a lot of new verticals and and it's quicker to launch products to market. So the p the pace uh is what I'm excited about and just seeing a lot of opportunities um especially in areas where there are large data sets that have been difficult to work with in the past and it's creating new opportunities there in all types of verticals. So, um, you know, we're not I'm not like, oh, we only I I'm not excited just about cyber security or just about fintech or wherever it may be, but I think there are lots of verticals that have haven't been disrupted yet that people can really go after now with not a lot of capital. And now how and if you have a structure in your head or a framework, but with how quickly things are moving, how do you evaluate potential opportunity when like everyone's, oh, it's this and AI and it's this and AI and it's this and AI and like everyone's coming at you with that kind of this is my carrot and this, you know, it's like this is my I've got the these two things, but um there's so much more now coming in. There's more noise, there's more people, ton more noise, right? How do you evaluate the and kind of differentiate between especially at the seed stage when it's it's early like you don't have that much data yet? Yeah, you're 100% right and I see a lot I'm so yes I'm seeing more opportunities but I'm seeing more of the same things. So then ultimately it's like you either are thinking gosh am I picking the right horse here? There's so many opportunities all going after the same I I believe in the problem area. I'm hoping I'm picking the right team. you don't love being in that situation because who knows if you're picking the right team um which is hard. So what we really look for or what I really look for in particular is um this kind of earned insight that a founder will have. Um so the techn is great but it's kind of a commodity and everybody's got it. So what really differentiates the market opportunity for me or the business opportunity is the founder or the founding team. Do they have the earned insight in that? there's typically a vertical market they're going after whether it's um you know in the payment space or in the insurance industry or whatever but have they worked in that industry or worked adjacent to that industry where they understand the customer painoint exceptionally well they understand the tech ecosystem that their technology is going to integrate within or replace. Do they understand the workflows of those users extremely well to understand what to build and then how people how they're going to have a product that will delight those customers and then do they understand the buying like the selling process or the the consumer buying process or the way to sell that product to the customers. Um a great product's awesome but by itself it's not all that useful if it can't be actually sold and delivered and maintained with a customer. So understanding and and it if you don't understand the industry and the vertical very well you are probably going to fail on the go to market side and the product support side even if you have an amazing product and then also with that insight typically comes relationships which are just so key. I mean AI by itself great but like no one wants to interact with an AI by itself like people like doing business with other people and people that they like and people with positive attitudes. Uh so do they have relationships where they have a running start where they can get into customers early, develop strategic partnerships early and channel partners for distribution and and ultimately for hiring. It's like is this a manager who can or a founder who can recruit the relevant people who also have relevant domain experience um with the kind of credibility where someone's going to be like, \"Yeah, I'm going to join that startup because this person knows exactly what they're doing. They know my space. they have the right product and this is going to be a huge company someday. So there it's it's that with that core of earned insight like that can be the kind of uh center of gravity I guess to make all those other things happen and spin around for recruitment customer acquisition knowing what product to build all those things but that c that earned insight of the founder is key. Last episode, uh, we had TX Zoo over from Fica Ventures on the show, and he was telling us this really cool story about how, uh, I believe they brought in a firm. I I'm I'm pretty sure it was from outside that analyzed all of their most successful investments to try to, uh, build some kind of um, signal, like what are the signals, right? And it's like, okay, is this a repeat founder? Has the founder had another exit in the past? um you know like all these different little um uh indicators and keys. And they found that the pattern the only pattern that they could see amongst their top 1 percentile or their top top startups was the speed at which founders responded to emails and that the single I love like most um linear pattern was responsiveness. Yeah. and that on the flip side, their least um successful were the ones that were least responsive or waited to send that email. And I found that fascinating. That is I was wondering in your, you know, in your world, well, you may not necessarily have a team that like analyzed it. When you kind of think about like your good investments versus your great ones or the ones that you are so excited about, is there traits that you've seen or are there patterns that you've seen that differentiate the good from the great not even the bad from the the bad, but you know in that kind of head-to-head arena? What are the things that really like drive the greatest of your portfolio companies forward? Yeah, for me it was the found in my best deals. where the founder responds to emails quickly. I I want to go back and look to that actually. Now you said that it's like I and I'm going to start using that as I thank UTX uh for that. Um but um uh for me it's been their when you started to say responsiveness. I was going to say to customers and the market, but in particular like really listening to customers and um especially early on. So when founders, you have to have a lot of conviction into what you're doing. But if you have too much conviction, you might be missing the biggest opportunity when you just think you're right. And you need to you need to you don't want to listen to everybody because not everyone's opinion is equal. But for a number of my best investments, the the kind of core business and the main business revenue driver wasn't it was a derivative of the original product or idea. It wasn't like the first thing, but then once they got into it, they realized like, oh, actually, we need to move over into this slightly adjacent space because a customer would say, \"Hey, I love what you're doing, but if it could do this, like it would really be amazing.\" And then what they found is that like the that doing the this is the part that re that was common with a lot of other customers and that was the real value driver going forward and a way to really differentiate. And so having that flexibility and adaptability early on where it's like it's this, you know, strong conviction lightly held where it's like, all right, yes, I firmly believe this, but I got to hear from customers once I start engaging and really listen and it's like, oh, maybe we should be doing this and and move. It's not it's not a complete pivot. it's more like a like slight turn, but those are the ones that have worked out the best where uh whether it's a business model tweak, maybe it's they lean into a feature that um so you know, one of my best investments was Duo Security, which pioneered two-factor authentication. Wow. They end up getting bought by CIS from bought by Cisco for three billion and you I was in there very lucky as with writing the very first check. Wow. And but like what they were doing originally and doing the two-factor authentication um they were able to pivot. They started more as a it probably goes into too much detail the beginning of this whole thing but it started more as like this enterprise approach and then what they realized was that uh for like enterprise cyber security almost but what they realized was having more endpoint access and making it easy for companies to use um and a much lighter product early on where it's like hey we're just going to provide a tool that will let you get access to the accounts allowed it to proliferate throughout the organization much more quickly as oosed to enterprise saying like oh I don't want this big heavy system that I need like tops down and it being kind of a bottoms up product and it scaled really rapidly. How do you balance and this could be both from an investor perspective so I let's do it from the investor perspective. How do you balance your datadriven analysis sort of that like show me the numbers, show like I I I'm a lo I'm an investor so I need to understand the logic of the data versus your intuition like I just I know it. I feel like this is where it's going. Has that ever been a challenge for you? Is that something that you think is a superpower of yours? what what's the what's the spread in in that um you know in that space of data versus intuition? Have you developed any sort of POV on that? Yeah, unfortunately at the seed stage we need to be a little bit more intu intuition focused because there's not a lot of data. There's some data but sometimes you can really be misled by that early data. Um you you need I mean so for a startup to really get big it needs they need to have a repeatable and scalable sales model and and a product that can be enjoyed by a lot of people a lot of potential customers. You can have a product that's killing it for one really large customer which is fant like I'm I have a startup right now which I've moved forward. I'm I'm I did the preede. I I'm just leading I led the seed round last week and it's a I'm still a little nervous about it in that like they only have a handful of customers. They're crushing it with these customers who are big Fortune 100 customers and they're largely in one vertical market. The company is called Credos AI and um they have some really large telecommunications customers, T-Mobile, Verizon, US Cellular which is awesome, huge customers and their product is doing a great job for these customers but you know can they break out of that vertical can they have get repeat that product with other companies other big companies who are solving a similar problem it's it's mainly around collecting late payments from customers in any given month like 20% of Verizon's customers don't pay their bill or at least are late, which maybe is understandable. It's kind of the US population. Yeah. And and they have tens of millions of customers, so chasing all these late payers. It well, one, it's a lot of money that's out there. And two, it's it's not it's inefficient to go after these people. So, Critos has a tool for that that leverages data and uh rapid AB testing with messaging. And it's it's pretty cool what they do, but it's like, wow, can they do this in other verticals? Um I I get nervous about so when I'm invested in obviously I wrote the check and we're moving forward. So I have enough conviction. Yeah. That that yes the product's working for these three big customers and I'm seeing in their sales pipeline interest in other verticals where people are saying yes I have the same problem um and they want it solved as well. So I think it's going to work out. Yeah. Yeah. But most of the time I'd prefer to see a situation where we have data with lots of different customers where lots of people are enjoying it and they've been able to demonstrate a repeatable scalable sales process but at the seed stage you typically will have just a handful of customers and you need to kind of take the leap like can this be repeated uh or not and we'll see like I love bringing VCs onto the show that started off as entrepreneurs you know early exeacts at big companies but they've been in the startup world and now they've And on the other side of the, you know, of the coin, when it comes to fundraising, what are some of the common mistakes that you see founders making? Like when when just a a general statement, general question, but what are some of the easy lowhanging fruit things that you're like, man, if they would just get this part right, it would help them so much more along the way. Is what are some common mistakes that you see founders make during fundraising process? The first two are some sound somewhat contradictory. one is you're always fundraising. So kind of you need to bear that in mind that you need to uh have tight messaging about what you're doing with people anytime anytime you're engaged with prospective investors even when you're not fundraising. You need to have in in your mind that you you effectively kind of are have this story like here's what I do. This is why it's important. Here's where we're at. Here's some like nuggets of traction or reasons to be interested. And then just kind of always lead with that in those conversations where where you're kind of framing for people like who are you? What are you doing? And and why should I be interested? Even if you're not raising. So you're always kind of doing that. Okay. And some founders like they'll engage with people when they're like I'm not in fundraising mode and they just start talking about random stuff and they're kind of missing an opportunity to frame in the investor's mind like this. Oh yeah, like this person's doing something that's really cool. They have some traction. I want to keep in touch with them and stay on. So they're they're kept warm. So when the founder is actually going to come to market, that person's gonna be very receptive to raising. There was a great founder. I'll do a shout out to um Nick Halverson at Ocfolio companies. But he did a great job of this. I attracted him for like two years with him, you know, he was kind of letting me know what he was doing, give me little nuggets of success, and we ended up leading a seed round, and they just closed on an A round, uh, $6 million A round at the end of last year, and they're ripping as a business. They're doing awesome. But he did a great job of of, you know, fundraising when I wasn't really ready to invest. I like, you guys are too early. But every time he'd reach out, he he did a good job of keeping me warm. And then when he was ready, we went for it. And I was I was very, you know, psyched to move forward with him. So he he did a good job of raising when he wasn't really raising. And I think other founders can and should do that. Now, the part that's contradictory is when where I see people fail is they they're not ready when they are actually fundraising. They kind of halfass it. What does that mean to you? To me, so they so they'll do like a maybe a crappy pitch deck. Maybe they won't even have a pitch deck. They'll just have they'll start sending around some emails. Hey, we're raising. We're going to raise, but they haven't really thought through all of the they're not they're not ready to engage with investors in a deep way. So, when once investors start probing like, \"Hey, well, let's check out your uh financial model. Like, how are you going to spend this three million bucks?\" And they're like, \"Ah, I don't really have a model. We'll get back to you on that.\" Um uh can I see some customer traction? Like, what's happening with with what you guys have done in the last 12 months? They're like, \"We don't really have metrics. Um, I'll get you something later.\" And you kind of lose that momentum. So, when you are going to actually formally start fundraising, like have your together. Start you just think in your head or talk to some friendly V, whether it's VCs or co-investors or angels or just your own team. It's like, if we were going to invest in our business, what would we want to know? And um have have some information ready. You don't need this massive data room, but have like some of the basics in place where you can start to engage in a diligence process because this is a momentum play. The fund like once you are going it it's kind of a a momentum process where you can't really drag it out because what founders need to remember is that aside from VCs generally having short attention spans like we're getting hit by people with new ideas multiple times every day. So there's always some new shiny object to potentially chase. So once you are engaged with somebody, you need to like really take advantage of that moment and try to seal the deal as quickly as you can. And if you don't have your together because you're going to start taking meetings and taking meetings and your time's going to get spread out pitching all the time. But if you blow it on the follow-up, it's all going to be a waste. So, and that's where I see founders mess it up a lot is they're just not ready for the followup and it think it just kind of never happens because the VCs end up getting pulled into other opportunities. Yeah. I wonder if that's where part of what TX was saying of that responsiveness that like when people are very responsive, it keeps you on that hook. you're like, \"Oh, there like the ping pong game is still going and the lack of it is like, oh, I've got all these other people that are going to, you know, be more attentive, more resp I got to keep moving.\" And so I I could totally see how that plays, you know, a role in it. Um, what are your non-negotiables? Meaning like they don't have to be built into the contract. They could just be more personality driven or spiritually driven or whatnot, but like what are your non-negotiables? It doesn't matter how good the investment is. It's just like it doesn't sit right with you, if any at all. Well, for us as a firm, part of our strategy is um we we're looking for capital efficient businesses generally. So, we're not going to go into deals where it's like we need to raise $200 million to for this to be successful. Like, if some founders focused on needing to raise a huge sum, we just don't even, you know, like that one's not for us. Like, we're going to end up with a tiny little piece of ownership in this company and we we're not really we don't want to go down that path. Um, and it's just not a great fit for us. But I I think on the on the personal side, so some of it is, you know, you kind of know it when you see it, but when you're interacting with somebody and um they think they've got it figured out and they're kind of combative. So when you're asking questions about their business and they're just really defensive out of the gate about everything, that's pro there's probably some real core insecurity there that is just going to be the business is probably going to be doomed. Like that founder is just not going to get to a successful point if they're very defensive out of the gate about everything that they're doing. And to my prior point about like companies where we've had the best success is when they're the founder was really open to listening and being, you know, having those strong convictions lightly held where it's like, all right, hey, I'm willing to be slightly wrong, you know, wrong a bit on this and I change directions. But if you find a founder that feels like they've got it all figured out, those are the ones where I, you know, I'm ending the the Zoom or the meeting ASAP. Yeah. And when you see in those questions, you're like, \"No, I just I can't even I don't want to work with this person going forward longer term.\" Um because it it's startups are hard. You're going to have lots of hard conversations. No one's got it all figured out. We're we're we're operating in this whole realm of uncertainty. if you think you you know all the answers like you're deliluding yourself and that's going to be uh a no no. Um yeah, now sometimes and now I'm sure it's very case by case, but sometimes I imagine that that comes because it's like a learned behavior early on. You're like my my older brother always, you know, and so I've got to explain why my thing is right or like they don't get it or something. And it's almost like eventually becomes this blind spot of theirs because they're so in it and they almost like can't read the like emotional cues. So, you know, let's like use your own your own children as a mentoring uh opportunity here. How would you describe to them like like how do you help someone spot that quality in themselves? Like you know, you care about it's your kid. you want him to understand. And so, how can you help someone spot that? And is there anything you think they can do or is it like you've just, you know, it's kind of like that's a personality trait that I've real I I don't want to work with, but in if you were to give advice to someone or you were to try to help them see that blind spot. Anything come to mind of like how you would help them understand why that's an issue and how they can maybe improve upon it? I don't really know. I mean, I think it's a hard question. It sure is. I mean, I I think a lot of it's through repetition. So where you know for for us we get to I'm kind of interviewing people all the time trying to understand their businesses and so forth. So you know there's some of that pattern recognition that you get. Um but I I think some of it's you know I know it's a cliche but about trusting your gut but you just get feelings about people sometimes and it's like you just really do have to listen to those. Um, I mean sometimes I I don't do as good of a job as I should do in that regard because I'm so in love with the idea or the product and it's you start to overlook things about the founder and um you just got to step back and remember no actually the founder is is 90% of the of the answer here or at least the driver of what's going to be successful and you you can't you can't cut corners around the founder. Now, switching the conversation over a little more towards the VC route and like more of like strategic, how do you source new opportunities? And have you found any strategies to be most effective? Some people go to events all the time. Some people, you know, work off their alumni network. Um, in your world, in your experience, what's been the best strategy for you? Obviously, you've got this, you know, almost never- ending positive attitude which makes and attracts people to want to work with you and be with you, but just in general, is there a specific way in which you found uh to find these amazing startups? There's so many VCs like how the freak do you find these people and so what's worked best for you and what advice do you have for others? This is something I feel like everyone needs everyone's trying to continuously improve on. So, I don't claim to have mastered it. I I definitely want to keep getting better. But what's been most effective for me is um not being passive about it. Uh so that means, you know, being proactive with conversations and reaching out to people. I mean, I get a lot of my deals from most of my the deals that we actually invest in are come from other VCs or from other founders that I've worked with in the past, founders and or board members. But usually I have to ask like sometimes they'll just people will send them over like hey you know I know you guys like these sorts of deals maybe this would be interesting to you. So, we'll do those. But I get a lot when I actually reach out to someone and I'll say, \"Hey,\" and sometimes I'll just be a little bit like cheeky about or whatever, but like, \"Hey, I got a million bucks burning hole in my pocket. Where should I put it?\" And I'll just send that text out to some people like or to other VCs. And it's a combo of later stage VCs that, you know, where their minimum check size is 5 10 million bucks or whatever and whereas I'm looking to do a million. So, we're not really competing. They may find they may know of a founder or someone maybe has left one of their existing portfolio companies and has spun something out and is doing something cool and like oh you should check that you should you go to that person and check them out. Or on the on the other side there are quite a few smaller VCs and we have quite a few here in Southern California who maybe only have a 510 million fund. They're writing quarter million dollar checks. They can't really lead necessarily a $3 million seed round. Um, so I'll reach out to them and be like, \"Hey guys, like you know, again, I got a million bucks burning a hole in my pocket. Like, what are you looking at? What's interesting? What should I invest into?\" And things come through that. But if you just kind of sit back and hope that the deals are going to start coming because even if you have planted the seeds and even if you are going to the parties and even if you are doing that, you have to remind people like try to get top of mind. I know you do all the advertising stuff, but you have to it is almost like that ad. You need that nudge to get people be like, \"Oh yeah, actually here's there's this one thing you might be interested.\" Yeah. Well, I mean, I think there we have this thought that's like, \"Oh, everyone must be thinking about me or like they know I'm the guy that does this, so of course they'll reach out and you almost like just forget that they have a thousand things going on and they just need a little, you know, a little touch.\" And I also love what you said, um, it reminds me like Jesse Sler, someone that I really look up to, talks about, you know, you have to like create your own luck. And like people are like, \"Oh, you know, oh, Jeff got lucky with this company or lucky with that.\" but they're not like seeing that it was like that message is what created that luck opportunity and um it's really you know if you want it go get it type of a mindset. Yeah 100%. So, one of my when I was helping run one of our portfolio companies, company called MPHI, one of my speaking of luck, one of my favorite interview questions I would just simply ask, are you lucky? And it was really interesting to hear the responses and you we obviously we tried to some of it was a positive attitude element, but we wanted to hire people who thought they were lucky. They might not have truly been lucky. Yes. But people who at least believe they were lucky because they're creating their own luck. typically they're proactive and you know we were a startupish company where we were growing quickly. We needed people who were comfortable with ambiguity. The the roles were changing all the time because the company was doubling in size every year and we needed people who felt like you know I'm creating my own luck. I can create opportunities forelves and I can yes I can create this new process in the company that no one's done before because it needs to be done or we just needed people who are proactive. But it was interesting. You'd hear great stories and or pe people who would say like, \"Oh, I'm I've had the worst luck and this this and that.\" Sometimes, look, sometimes you could have some recent bad luck. And it's legit bad luck. But hearing how people respond to the bad luck is then was the followup. It's like, \"All right, well, what did you do about that?\" Or like, \"How did you respond?\" And um it was just a great it was my favorite interview questions that and honestly it it that was a a key uh determinant for us. Yeah, at that time I was like, \"All right, should we hire this person or not?\" Yeah. My my favorite we I haven't done this question in a long time. I might need to bring it back, but um I would sit down with the candidate and I would say to them, \"You wake up in the morning and you have zero dollars in your bank account and you go, \"Oh my gosh, I have no money in my bank. How would you make your first $100?\" And so I had this one one kid, one one young man, freshman at USC, came in for an internship. He was dressed in a full suit. I'm like, \"Dude, it's a startup. Like, you don't need a suit here.\" And we sit down. I'm interviewing him. And I get to that question. I say, \"All right, TJ.\" Like, you wake up in the morning and your bank account is empty. All you have is the clothes on your back. How would you make your first $100? And he looks at me and he goes, \"I have the clothes on my back.\" And I go, \"Yeah, the clothes on your back. That's it.\" He goes, \"I'd go right to another job interview.\" Um when you think about um just like your journey in business, in entrepreneurship, in venture capital, uh mostly venture capital, uh you've had the chance to work at a huge like a bigger later stage VC fund, earlier stage, and I'm just curious like when you look back on it all, what were some or a just pivotal moment for you? like a pivotal moment or decision that then like significantly changed the direction or what you wanted to do? I mean, I know you like went to London and like you've had a lot of these big moments, but in VC in particular, was there one kind of fork in the road that like completely just changed the trajectory of like how your, you know, career turned out? Yeah, good question. I think there's kind of two of them. One was I I started um I was at Saffron Hill Ventures in London where I started and I moved to a different firm called Baronia where I end up staying for 11 years. But uh when I was at Barangia it was a merger of two a British company and an American company uh small firms and in that process the merger was a little bit contentious and messy and basically a lot of the people in the British office quit. So I was in that London office and it was like me and couple people left and they had a portfolio of 30 40 companies. They had capital that they had to deploy on a certain schedule and I was like 27 years old and one of the last people standing and they're like well I guess you're now on like these 10 boards and we need to get these deals done and go for it. And I, you know, felt like holy my god like I'm not sure I'm ready for this. And it was one of these I just got an opportunity really that that created at that point, but I really leaned into it and embraced it and tried to make the most of it and be the, you know, do the best that I possibly could. But that accelerated my uh I was basically doing stuff at an age I probably shouldn't have been doing, but I leaned into it and went for it. And that really set me up to do um you know I think to have a solid venture career from there and I think to become a a good board member early. So for some VCs they're you know they maybe don't get board opportunities till later in their career but I was instantly on a bunch in my 20s and I wasn't awesome at that time. I was getting better. I I'm still getting better I like to think. But that was a huge help where I just was given a lot of responsibility early on that maybe I wasn't probably truly ready for but there was no one else to do it. And I'm really grateful you know for having had that chance at Beeria. That was number one. And then two is also Beher related. When I left Beeria I I I left it to help run my portfolio company MPHI which is a consumer electronics company. It was one of my investments. Um in 2010 I invested into it. It was doing you know barely anything in revenue. And then in the next three years went from zero to 50 million or nearly zero but you know call a couple million to 50 million in revenue. The two founders asked me to come on board to help run it at one of the board meetings and I was a you know Baron a board member at that time and that was a big decision for me where I I left the VC side of the table and went to the operator side of the table and I helped run MPHI then for the next three years we went from 50 to 250 million in revenue and then we sold it to a public company called Zag. But like that was a big decision for me because it it took me off the venture path. Yeah. So I left the firm, you know, it was it was a friend, you know, friendly departure and I still was on the board of a number of the Beeria companies after I left. But it was a hard decision to leave cuz I loved that team that I was working with at Beeria. Um you're still early at that like you're not full, you know, you're not 35, 40, 45. You're like should I is this the right decision for me at that point? Wow. Yeah. So I left. Well, at that point I was actually I had had turned 40 at that point. So, I've been at Ber for a lap. There we go. We're back. We're back. So, I I was but I was at this decision where I'm like, man, I actually have a really great thing going here with B&G. I love the team. We're doing well as a firm, but I've always wanted to work at a startup. You I was kind of an accident. I didn't mean to be a VC as it was. I wanted to be at a startup and MPHI was crushing it. I liked the founders a lot. It it was a super fun company to work with. It was a rocket ship and it was and it got me back to Southern California which all those things I wanted to do but I was leaving a lot on the table literally um in leaving Baronia which you know was expensive to leave um but it was a different career move which you know and I had you know a a great learning experience with MPHI and you know we got a good outcome there and um now I'm back on the VC side of the table so things worked out for me to get back here but it was and I'd like to think I'm a much better investor now for having had those three years of that intense grind at MPHI going from that 50 million to 250 million in revenue. We went from like 50 employees to 320 became a global business. You know that was um that was a ton of work. Um but I learned so so much from it and got most of these white hairs from it. But it it was it was cool. I'm curious like have have you witnessed your own investment strategy evolve over time or do you find that you know the steady beat of the drum the chop wood carry water mentality um has carried you well and I ask it more from the context of I feel like ventures changed a lot startups have changed a lot there was COVID came then there was the postcoavid bit of a recession now we're coming back and like just things are moving there's AI there's crypto like things are just speeding Have you had to adjust how you strategically invest in companies? Whether it's how quickly you invest or how much time you spend on diligence or um just in general, have you found yourself having to evolve or do you feel, you know, um proud in the fact that you have really been able to stay true to like these are how this is how I do it here? Yeah, that's a great question. So, the process is compressed generally in the seed market. It's gotten more competitive so because of how many VCs there are so many more VCs at the seed stage like than when I was doing it earlier in my career. We used to be able to take our time. We used to be able to do a ton of diligence and um and the companies were typically a little bit further along um ironically like they you know and you had more to look at I guess uh in a lot of ways but um you so I do a lot more customer referencing you know and now things are going pretty quickly and you have to so we end up doing deals a little faster now than we had in years past and I think that's largely driven by competition But I also think some of it's compressed too because it's easier and when I talk about founders having their their together when they are going to engage in the fundraising process people can come to the table with a it's not a there's so much content around about like what should founders do in a fundraising process like when people are really ready to engage like they actually have a lot of the stuff that you want to see and you can see it really quickly and um and that's all been really great. So you can make decisions pretty quickly um in terms of getting the data and doing the diligence. And um I also think that with sales cycles have been for companies have been compressed and the ability to deploy software has shortened where people can start running sometimes in days or hours utilizing tools. Whereas before if someone won a customer it might take like a month for them to get implemented and get going. And um you can now look at so many customers that and you can see a little bit of the life cycle of a customer almost a little quicker now than you used to in the past because you can win customers quicker now. So you can see if they're churning, you can see if they're not using the product anymore. You know, maybe just the one internal champion's using it then no one else wants to use it and you're like, \"Okay, maybe this isn't going to go anywhere. They're going to have a hard time upselling in the future because no one else cares about the product.\" Like you can see some of those things a little earlier now. So how have things changed for us? I think, you know, we're we're making somewhat faster decisions, which in some respects you might think, well, that's maybe not a good thing. You're rushing a judgment. I think we're still checking a lot of the same boxes we've always tried to mentally check around the product and the market opportunity, the competition and the management team, but we're just doing it a little bit more efficiently than we have in the past. And some of it's through the AI tools, too. Like market research used to be really a slog. And you can get access to information now in seconds that um even competitive landscape and some of the stuff you can get insights on pretty early which is great. And then honestly just technologies like zoom just have removed the friction out of like doing meetings with people whether even if it's customer referencing or whatever but like that's also compressed things. has I'm curious do you have like do you have any philosophy or perspective uh postcoid on inerson verse zoom meaning let's say you've got two great founders they both are in a similar market with similar technologies with similar founding team and structure and for the most part they're about as even as they can be in that regard but one of them uh flies in from New York to sit down with you in person and the other one takes it from Chicago in their office or in their on Zoom Is there any weight to you? Have you like um Yeah, I'm curious. Yeah. Not just because they're making that sacrifice for me, but for me that biggest indicator is how are they going to win customers in the future? If they have a big customer on the line, are they going to try to win that account from Zoom? Are they going to get their ass on the plane and go seal the deal? And that to me would be the biggest indicator right there. And honestly, and whether it's TX's, you know, email responsiveness element, like a lot of what I'm looking for when I'm engaging with a founder in that process, it's yes, they're kind of selling me on their company, but so I'm now getting a little bit of a view of what it's like when their customers are being sold to by them and is that a responsive process? Are they are they listening to me? Are they, you know, in terms of like hearing the feedback and really understanding where we're at? um you know are is what they're providing well organized and stuff is it what I'm asking for um that those are that's kind of part of the process like oh yeah do we want to move forward with this person and I I'd mentioned Nick at Ocace he was incredible at that followup he was so organized all the stuff was together he was rapidly responded it's funny like I TX probably on to something I'm going to start using that that email responsiveness I'll let him know he's he's secrets out cat's out of the bag but well even for founders I mean, hey, they should know it matters. They should know how important it is. I think some of it is again like, you know, you're running 100 miles an hour. You've got teammates and your family and you you sometimes lack there are just blind spots. You can be the most empathetic person and not realize until you hear someone say it like, \"Oh that's the thing. Oh man, I need to get on that thing.\" And it's in your it's that's like the one thing that really is in your control, you know? It's uh you can be on top of that. Um and and yeah, that's that's that's really uh I think good to hear you say that because I think that you know uh the younger generation, you know, uh the the young 20 something year olds I think have with especially uh co being part it's like they didn't even go to college in class. And so um I think it's important because a lot of the new up and cominging businesses these they're run by 19year-olds, 20-year-olds, 22 year olds. And so to hear that, you know, if they're going headto head that like that little extra thing, that one and a half hour flight from LA to SF or and well, and it's not just that like making the sacrifice of time and showing like I I I'm committed and I want to try to win this, you know, I care about this. The personal relationship is so important. I mean, it's basically like a marriage when you're taking money from a seed investor. M I mean most marriage I think it's like 50% of the marriages in California don't last more than 5 years or is even 3 years. I forget what the stat is but it it's something sad. Uh but seed investments and we're we're in companies for seven to nine sometimes more years. That's longer than most marriages. Yeah. And if you're only kind of consummating that relationship over Zoom, you're I think you're missing something there because I think there is something with the face to face. Yeah. And the personal chemistry and interaction. And I think you just get more reads on the person too. Um at least from you as the investor. But I think it goes the other way like the honestly it's probably more important for the founder to really understand who are they taking money from. In fact, a negative signal for me. You asked about like red, you know, like red flags and like hell nos. I mean, it's for me it's not a complete like hell no, but if the person that I'm investing in doesn't ask for a reference from me, that's a really bad sign. Like they they need to be taking diligence from me. Like they're engaging in a rel, you know, partnership with me. They should have a sense of what I'm like to work with. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I might be friendly on the Zoom and interact nicely on emails and look at positive attitude, but maybe secretly I'm a jerk. Yeah. Yeah. You know, like I'm not. But like, you know, they should ask. So I I I really want founders to talk to some of the founders like who have you recently invested with you know can I talk to that person 100% like I want they should be asked like all founders should ask that of VCs before I mean you can do it postterm sheet or like when you're in the term sheet phase it's like hey you know I'd like to get some references um because honestly and unfortunately there are a lot of in our industry and um you know for the founders like if you have a choice you know keep you want to keep out of your life. Of course, it sounds obvious, but like yeah, you really do cuz it it can be a huge source of pain. I mean, for one of my companies, we just they just raised a series A and we I'm going to not mention the names of this company, but like part of that A- round was to take out an existing investor that was a huge negative force on the company and a massive energy drain on the founder. It was terrible. And I'm so happy these guys are gone. Um, but man, it was such a negative. And to make matters worse, we had he he did reference checks and got negative feedback about this VC and still move forward. And um and and they were as advertised, in fact, even worse than advertised. And it was terrible. So like he he even did the references and he and he ignored the negative signal and that was a miss. Yeah. So like founders out there like due diligence on your investors prior to taking money from them. Yeah. My dad always says you can't do good business with bad people. And totally that I love it. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. How do you foresee the future or like how do you foresee like the ongoing evolution of venture capital uh in regards to AI in regards to I you know remember being like the guy that was like oh thank god the creative industry is safe from AI you know and then it's like the first thing that comes out is like oh copywriter is gone you know creative strategist like no no problem like chat GBT can do everything and now you're seeing things like, oh, upload models, oh, take the data room and just toss it. It's like there's so much and you can either be on the side that's like, oh, this is going to kill my job or take things away from me or use it as the tool. And I'm just curious like, do you see, you know, I think that's one one of the cool parts about you coming from a startup is that you're you're always like, well, where are we going to be in a year or in two years? And you can kind of like see out a little bit. when you like close your eyes and look out into the world of venture, do you see it changing and evolving rapidly and and how do you kind of see um your role evolving over time? Yeah. So, I guess there's two things there and in the venture industry where it it's becoming a very like bifrocated market where you're you have these mega funds that are they're sucking up 70 80% of all the dollars that go into venture capital are going into these massive massive funds that like the Sequoas or the like Sequoas Andre Exactly. Excel some of these like multi-billion dollar funds and they can't deploy capital in small checks efficiently. They just it does not work. It's too much overhead to manage all of the things or like Yeah. And to source the deals and Yeah. They I mean they would be if they were writing million2 $2 million checks, they'd have to do like five deals a day. Mhm. You know, to deploy the capital over time. It's just it doesn't work that way. And then it's a managing the portfolio is the part that really doesn't scale. Writing the check is kind of easy. But then tracking it and all this stuff, it it becomes a mess. and um that part doesn't work. So, they're kind of moving upstream and and writing the bigger checks, which is good for the growth market. Well, I don't know if it's good for the growth market, but you know, there's plenty of money up there. Mh. And then at the seed market, you're going to have a lot of more firms like us, which I consider ourselves like a boutique venture firm where we're managing, you know, $50 million at a time where we are writing the $1 million checks. But I think the pool it's going to the number of VCs are going to shrink in in the seed space which is not as good for founders that you know I think there are going to be less potential sources of kind of traditional early stage capital because like the a lot of the the big guys have gotten too big or they're just not even really playing in the space with a caveat that like in the Bay Area those deals are still getting done and people but they're like it's a $5 million seed round with like you someone with a PowerPoint like, \"Hey, here's five million bucks.\" Like, I can't write anything smaller than that, but go for it. Let me know how you launch it in my pocket. Exactly. So, like that's what happens up here, but like it doesn't happen so much down here in SoCal and a lot of the other markets. Um, so that that fragmenting of the market is is kind of interesting. It's leaving this big hole in the middle of people that used to play here. Um, so it's ch it's that's tough. I think that's going to create a weird dynamic for founders. But on and on then on the company side, you know, you were talking about all these AI tools and how do people avoid the disruption going forward or how do they benefit from the disruption and benefit from it. I mean, it kind of goes back to my earned insight point and talking about relationships. I mean, relationships really matter. The technology by itself doesn't sell itself. People don't want to use it uh, you know, deeply within their organization without some kind of accountability or interaction with it going forward. long term I think for most vertical markets. So I think you need someone to sell it. You need someone to do the customer support. There's always going to be some support element. Um I think there needs to be that product element where you are constantly making the product better. And yes, you can do analytics and see how people are using the product and what features are being used the most. But like you're going to need someone engaging with that customer like what should we be building next? What's another painoint that you're solving that we haven't addressed yet? There needs to be that relationship element and that is going to be that's always going to matter and it's going to be the big differentiator as these AI tools are pretty commoditized. Yeah. I mean people aren't it's funny like what's really changed for me in the last 20 years is people and one big difference you asked about the diligence. We used to do like source code walkthroughs. We spent a lot of time understanding why the technology is so hard to replicate and build. And we'd ask a lot about patents like what what what's your IP? I don't ask about IP anymore at all really because you're almost just assuming that like it's all commoditized like everyone's doing it and whatever you're doing is going to be ripped off. So like what other moes can you create that are not about the technology and it's usually these relationships or strategic partnerships or something else that gives you some edge that's not the tech because the tech is becoming the commodity now. So like it's so funny like I don't even and we don't yeah we I don't look at source code anymore. We we don't go through that cuz it's it's all going to change and soon everyone's going to kind of have the same tech platform to work from or at least things that are similarish, you know, whether you're using anthropic or if you're on open um um you know, open air catchb these they're all kind of the same. Yeah. Yeah. And then they're changing really quickly too. So it's like the AI like no they are not the same. Exactly. And look, I appreciate they're not, but like for you, most applications are going to be built on top of it, like those differences are pretty nominal. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, yeah, the tech matters less and less, but what really differentiates are those relationships, the ability to have the strategic partnerships. Um, I mean, business model used to be a differentiator, but again, that can be easily more easily replicated when everyone is leveraging the same technology base. Um, so it's like where do you get a cost advantage? Those are hard now. M um so it's it's interesting but in a world that's become increasingly commoditized like it's getting harder to do venture uh or it's getting harder to find something that you feel like is truly unique. Yeah. Like I backed a number of deals where it's like we have these PhDs who are like some of the only handful of people on the planet that know how to do this. Like that doesn't happen anymore. Now kind of everybody knows how to do it or it's it's pretty easy to replicate or um get a boost from the AI. Exactly. Or to quickly catch up. I always wonder like it's got to be tough for you at some level when you have operational experience and not just operational like sold like been through the thing that everyone you're investing is trying to get to this place but you're not actually like sitting in the room building the company and so you only have so much you can do to drive success. How do you define success for yourself? like how what feels like success for you as a VC and what are you oriented towards? I mean that a generic level at least with my investors we're trying to triple everybody's money minimally. So that's like the you know what I you know we're investing money I'm trying to generate a return and I'm trying to generate at least three. If you give me a million bucks I want to give you back three and hopefully a lot more. And some of our prior funds are doing that which is great. Um that's like high level. That's my main benchmark. But from like taking it down another level, you know, how do I define success? I for me it's it's helping companies live up. It sounds generic, but it's like helping companies live up to their fullest potential, whatever that ends up being. So, you know, when you start on day one, you hope that everyone's potential is being the next Google. But you realize over time because of competition, because of market dynamics, like things that happen with the management team, whatever, uh it's not going to be a huge huge home run. But if you can redefine, you know, you have to constantly redefine success along the way for each company and in terms of like what's realistic and within time frames that kind of hopefully for me at least align with what we're doing, which is like a 10-year period. So you know what is success a modified success in this tenure for each one of these companies and for each one of those founders. Um, you know, some VCs, you know, feel like anything less than a 10 times return cash on cash is a disappointment. But, you know, there are some situations where you can feel like some of the deals I'm most proud of are situations where we, you know, maybe got three, five times our money, but like at one point it was going to be zero and and those founders are now worth, you know, tens of millions of dollars. and like they are now off and going doing really great things themselves and kind of paying it forward and now they're angel investors and new things and like that feels like a great success and I take a lot of you know pride and joy out of seeing that happen even though it wasn't one of my best deals. Jeff little philosophical uh I don't even know what what word to use for say but when you hang the gloves up when it's all done no more investing you're fully retired you're you're done done what do you want your legacy to be amongst the founders that you invested in so I've always what I aspire to now is to be the first person that they are calling with good or bad news um as it relates to their company and I want to be that person for them as long as possible and maintaining that relationship over time. And um in fact, my wife gets really upset with me generally because most founders, they work their asses off and they're not doing like these uh you know, emotional phone calls in the middle of the day, you know? So, by the time they're done working, it's by 10:00 at night or 11 and then they're texting me like, \"Hey, do you have time to talk?\" I'm like, \"Okay.\" And I was like, I thought like you're gonna take it's gonna be about midnight. you're just starting to talk with someone outside, you know, someone right now and like but you I want to be that person for that founder because that's when they're needed. And for me, like I I would like to if they will look back, you know, on me is like, you know, Jeff's the person that I always go to, you know, when I needed someone or I, you know, the first time we closed that big deal was the first person I let know. Like that's the relationship that I want as a seed investor. And then to kind of maintain that over time, that's my that's my goal. Jeff, you're the man. This was such a great episode.

season 2 is soon to follow without further ado let's get into demo day [Music] hello everybody my name is Steve ritzy I'm normally behind the scenes here on demo day but today I am in front of the microphone and the camera interviewing our host Sean Gould Fadden Sean and I have actually known each other for over 10 years now we first met in Miami where we played soccer together Sean was our goalie you know normally good the goalies the kind of unathletic one on the team who's not as fast or has as much stamina as the rest of the club but uh Sean you know we do those half mile laps you were always the first one to finish you would be lapping people when we had three or four laps to go oh it's appreciated that about you and you know I was captain the team you were captain of the team but you were also the goalie which is sort of a true like captain's position where you're sitting in the back you see everything happening in front of you so I wanted to start with little question about soccer and business and how is captaining a team or leading from the back similar to running your own business mmm Steve thank you for interviewing me thank you for the listeners watching demo day this is gonna be an exciting episode to talk about my story and how we got to where we are when I think about soccer and being a captain of the team you'd mention something around leading from the back and I think that's really the most similar correlation between the two that when you're a goal keeper you're really standing the very back of the field and you have the full vision of the field in front of you and there's really a couple of elements that are key to being a successful goalkeeper right the first one is really around having that singular mission so it's really simple when you're playing on a soccer game the mission or the goal is to win the game and the way you win that game is by keeping everyone on the field totally aligned right so you have your defense they have to all be in sync with each other you have your midfield all being in sync with each other you have your forwards all being in sync so this concept of alignment and me sure that everyone is on the same page rowing in the same direction moving towards the same goal or the same mission it's really similar in business now on soccer you have like each game is an individual you know opportunity to win or each season you have like you know the tournament or the championship and so it's very clear like what the objective or the mission is but in business there is no clearly defined you know milestone or clearly defined victory and so what you have to do is almost create your own game you have to create your own soccer fields and I think one of the biggest things I've learned in business is really to differentiate between this concept of family and the concept of team and what's really amazing about soccer for anyone that you know grew up playing on club or high school or college when you are sitting on that bus driving six eight hours with your team to go show up to a tournament you're staying in the same hotel you have this feeling of family like the togetherness of it the moving in the same mission there's there's very um there's very much so a feeling of we are a family but with that being said something that I learned later is that family is unconditional right you don't get into an argument with your little brother your big brother and all of a sudden just be like oh I'm gonna let you go you're off the team or you're out of my family right family love this is unconditional but high-performance teams are conditional right these are teams that are conditional on performance teams that are conditional on how you vibe with the rest of your squad and I think in the earliest days of coefficient labs because of the fact that you know this is really only my first real venture of course we'll talk a bit more about what we did in college in high school and elementary school but this is really my first venture leading a real team growing as a real team and the first couple of years I really felt and not only felt I talked like we are a family word this one happy family you know even now we're being filmed in a you know a company office that was a apartment complex converted to an office so it almost feels like you've got these roommates and we're all this family but there is this moment where I was talking to a mentor and I was talking to him about you know what I love the most about coefficient labs is like we're just this family and he looked at me and he said Shawn families are unconditional you know teams are conditional and you should think about coefficient labs and you should think about business a little bit more like your club soccer team or your your university soccer team and what he meant by that was you know Steve when you and I were on the soccer team we loved every member of that team like they were our family but if Jared went out the night before a game and was boozing it up drinking came in came late to practice didn't have the same energy it wasn't that absurd for us to think oh yeah the coach is gonna bench Jared like he's not gonna be able to play in the game today and I think that when I shifted my mindset away from we're this family this unconditional loving family too we are a well-oiled high-performing team it really shifted my mindset and enabled coefficient labs to keep taking the next steps and keep having each member of the team wanting to better each other and so soccer had a really big impact in my way of thinking as it as it lays today yeah well if if you remember we actually your junior year had to ask somebody to leave the team he's one of our better players but he was mean to the other players he wasn't a team player but he would score almost every game but he was bringing the entire rest of the club down and there was no choice he said it wasn't unconditional we said if you prove yourself you can maybe come back later but right now we can't have that attitude around staying on the soccer metaphor briefly you know playing with you I was always a very attack-minded midfielder and so over the course of 90 minutes you might have had two three five times yell at me to make sure I had my man marked right and as the goalie like you said you see everything so similar to in a game where you can't be putting every player exactly where you want them all the how does that work in business where this company has grown over the past few years and you can't have as much will say control over the positioning of every team member every day what does that transition been like for you yeah I mean I think we'll talk about it a little bit more down the road of the podcast but I think a lot of it has to do with this concept of strengths and weaknesses when you're growing up and you're playing Little League soccer Little League baseball right it's kind of like a you try a ton of things you're the pitcher you're the catcher you're first base you're second base but really once you start to move into high school in college and you get a bit older you you start to specialize into these different these different areas and I think that you know some coaches or some mentors or some managers really try to take people and that maybe they have a weakness right maybe they're not the most agile or they don't have enough speed and they really try to double down on their weaknesses how can I help these people level up on their weaknesses whereas other coaches and other mentors say let's not focus on your weaknesses let's try to double down or triple down on your strengths let's try to put you into a position to succeed and I think that is very similar to soccer that you know often times there are attacking forwards that should be attacking forwards that's where they thrive that's where they do their best work but because of the you know the norms of building a team or soccer maybe they try the coach when I say they I mean the coach or a manager tries to say you know hey Steve maybe you should be more of a midfield attacker and they try to mold you and help you work on some of these weaknesses for me personally what's worked the best has always been to try to put my team members in a position to succeed and sometimes that means quite literally moving them around the fields bringing someone that was a forward back to midfield changing my left defender to my right defender but in today's world of business it means just communication and I think that's the like the through line in uh you know being a goalkeeper and in today I think you'll definitely remember this from from soccer I was constantly yelling at the team in a way not yelling like you're doing a bad job but you know mark your guy on the left mark your guy on the right see the guy he's moving and he's moving out check the guy behind you always being communicating and I think that it's changed from oh you've got to mark this person into you know all of the unknowns of business I I just recently heard this um this like really interesting way of thinking about growth in sales and it starts out like when you're in your very you know your first couple of months and this is certainly true coefficient labs the goal is like we need to get across the street I can see across the street I know how I want to get there so we go and we get across the street then it becomes I need to go across town I can visually understand and see where the end of the town gets to but I'm gonna have to take a little bit of a risk cuz I can't exactly see it then once you get across the town you say I'm gonna go across the country and you know intellectually how you're gonna get across the country but it's a bit further then you think International and so each of these steps starts out as everything is very clear it's very simple and as you grow and you add more team members whether it's soccer you know anyone that plays ping-pong or tennis knows there's only a little bit you have to think about it's me versus you one on one maybe two on two once you start moving to basketball and soccer and football you need to play a bigger game dynamic or a bigger team dynamic so I think that you know it's really around putting your team in a position to succeed at least personally that's how I've been running my biz right and I think that now that our team is you know eight or ten people instead of well 12 instead of two or three you can have people who can really focus on what they're best at instead of saying okay we have four people and everybody needs to do twenty things so we're gonna kind of go back to the beginning now like we always do on this podcast Shaun tell us where you grew up and what you did for fun as a kid mm-hmm contrary to my looks and appearance people have thought that I am Greek Italian Mexican Persian pretty much every possible you know nationality you could be but I grew up you know born and raised in America grandparents from America I did have some you know great or great great grandparents uh that were from Belarus Russia shoutout Gary Vaynerchuk I'm almost positive or cousins but that's for another podcast so mostly most of my family you know grew up in the west coast of the United States my dad and his family grew up in the East Coast in Jersey New York and I grew up in a really small town Manhattan Beach California for anyone that has been there you know it's an incredibly beautiful um just it's an amazing place to grow up I went to junior lifeguards when I was in the summer I play sports with my friends I always loved the fact and still love the fact that I have the same 15 to 20 friends that I went to elementary school we're all still going to their you know our weddings and raising our children together and we had a very small community I always joke that it was maybe 15 or 20 years before I actually went to Hollywood or downtown LA you know when when you grow up in a small town like Manhattan Beach there's almost no reason to leave this sort of place we used to call it the bubble you know we would go into high school we'd say are you gonna leave the bub today right and it was this idea that you have the beach you have a nice school system fairly middle to upper-middle class families not a lot of hardships being brought my way and I certainly was not the kid growing up that had to overcome you know being from a poor family or you know having some of the hardships of being a you know an african-american or different nationalities or different ethnicities growing up I had a lot of the privileges of growing up in a very middle to upper-class neighborhood family and a lot of my a struggle or a lot of my hardships came more from a you know a personal perspective a family and health and you know even myself like I was incredibly incredibly overweight as a young child and so dealing with kids that were teasing me or that didn't think I was good enough to make a specific sports team so a lot of my you know chip on my shoulder came from my own self fulfilling prophecies if you will not as much of my external hardships that were brought upon me yeah you know when I was talking earlier about your running at soccer now when we first met and we were 19 or 20 you were in the midst of getting yourself in super super good shape but the people who didn't know that you know looked at you one of our really close friends and roommates said there's there's no way he runs fast there yeah there's no way but I know that you know from I imagine the first time you played sports you're you're one of those competitive people I've ever met and I know that that sense of competition has driven you throughout yeah I think it really really stemmed from you know elementary school like I said I was always the overweight kid I was always the one that was you know oh you're too fat to do this you're too fat to do that you can't be the team captain you're not fast enough you're not agile enough you're not good enough in all of these areas and so early on it always was about like oh I'm gonna prove you wrong I would say to my friends like yeah I might be fat but like that keeps me cool that keeps me warm in the winter and gives me shade in the summer like I would always take all of these negatives and find ways to turn them into a positive her into a way of saying you know what [ __ ] you man I'm gonna show you like I could be the best at any sport I could be the best any video game I could be the best at anything and it doesn't matter how I look how I how I act um it's all in my own head and what I can do and I think it carried through in a lot of what I do you know it something about competition something about winning that feeling of winning like you know what I did it I put the effort and what happened when there was a moment you know I was graduating from high school and and and I know we'll talk more about high school I was graduating from high school and I had never had a girlfriend before I looked at all of my friends going to college you know partying having a good time I said you know what [ __ ] this I am gonna lose this weight I was something like 250 260 pounds at the time and very overweight very unhappy and I just didn't want to do it anymore and so what I would do is I would go to the gym and I would stay at the gym for maybe five to six hours at a time talking a long time I would go into the gym I would run on the treadmill for maybe like four miles I would get off the treadmill and I would go into the swimming pool I would go and do laps until I couldn't do laps anymore I even bought underwater headphones so that I could keep the jam going I would get out of the pool I would shower I would dry off I'd go back on the treadmill I would go again until I couldn't go anymore I jump back in the pool and so this idea of like I am going to do this I am going to get a girlfriend I'm going to figure this out and it started by saying like I don't have all of the tools I don't have the personal trainers or I don't have you know X Y & Z but what I have is time I have my own effort my own energy and I think that when I'm staying up at 1:00 a.m. 2:00 a.m. 3:00 and 5:00 a.m. right getting things done or it comes from this place of this is on me I know that you know maybe it's not the life for everyone but I can put this energy and and put this time in and as a result I will you know I will take the blame on my shoulders and I will take the rewards on my shoulders and I like the the image of the swimming pool right because you compare swimming alone in a pool to being a CEO and that's a lot of what it is people don't see the time that you're spending an hour just swimming back and forth just trying to better yourself so you talked about how you sort of growing up elementary school things were pretty pretty good for you then I know as you started high school you had some family health issues that that came up pretty early on when you were you know a young young kid so I'm you just tell us a little bit of about that and sort of how your your life changed when you were starting high school totally I think before jumping into high school it's important to frame the context around I love sports right so Sports enabled me to win if I had a team like like in elementary school if any of my friends are listening to this you're gonna love this every single day in elementary school every day at recess we would divvy up into two teams it would be my friends Rosen Kaminsky CJ Eric Tate you know a couple other crew and then it would be Jonathan Weiss's team every day we would play football my team against Jonathan Weiss is David Chism Brendon Pasha's if you're listening much love guys those are the enemies every day it was the same thing we would set up we would play there would be a winner there'd be a loser then once I got into high school I you know I knew I wanted to do business like business and making money was always my gym I was the kid doing a lemonade stand on like the path the bike path at the beach making a couple hundred bucks with my mom and my cousin um when I was in third grade really I think my first entrepreneurial experience was in third grade I'll never forget it pokeymon was the thing all of my friends would go they would buy these pokemon cards we would always like trade them or sell them and I realized that there were all of these kids that had like two of the three cards they needed that third card to complete their pack and that third card happened to be the shiny card so what I would do is I was take all of the shiny cards and I would put them into a deck into like a like a binder with you know kind of like a baseball card where you dropped them in the plastic folder and I would sell shiny only packs to the students in third grade so at a really young age I was always thinking about you know how can I take something kind of rebrand it repurpose it and sell it to other students so when I got into high school I was you know hanging out I'm a freshman just transitioning and I saw a I saw a card like a flyer on my on my car that said high-school students can make $18 an hour selling knives and I thought holy [ __ ] $18 an hour that's more money than I've ever liked thought of in my life I want to check this place out and so early on right when I became a freshman at school I joined this company called Cutco and Cutco for any of you know is this company where they basically it's like a direct sales multi-level I'm sure there's some pyramid scheme going on here but basically the idea is is you would get a set of knives and you'd go door to door to door to door to all of these different people's houses trying to sell them knives and at that time to me it became like the new sport it was something I could win at if I would go and I would sit down with someone and I could convince them to buy a pair of my knives that was like the same feeling of like winning in a sports game and so I knew freshman year that like I liked business I liked selling things and then BAM just like right in the middle of it I just absolutely got smacked in the face and that's just around family health and you know for anyone that listens to Gary Vaynerchuk Gary Vee has been someone that you know I first got introduced to when I was a sophomore in college almost 10 years ago someone I look up to a lot and one of the things he talks about is you know hey Gary like how do you keep such a great perspective when things are going bad how do you keep that perspective positive and he always talks about how like what he does is he sits there and honestly pretends or tries to get himself to be pleased or his family his mom his dad his brother his sister is so sick or something horrible happens to him that by thinking about the people he loves the most having something tragic happened it's able to help him put into perspective how little this thing is that he's tackling and it's such an it's such a nothing burger and I felt and think about that often that I sort of got hit with that early I felt when I was a freshman in school even with this sort of new Cutco business everything around me was falling apart around my family my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer my dad had this incredible serendipitous body scan that was given to him by his company a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and they found in this scan that he had 95% of his arteries were totally blocked that he had that the doctor said to him you have hours two days to live and they caught it and gave him a emergency five-way heart bypass all in the same year this is two months three months after my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer mom is sick losing her hair dad is in the hospital we don't know if he's even gonna make it both of my grandparents who are in their late 80s at the time grandma passes away first grandfather passes away second now these are people that I spend every day with all the time and even on top that my [ __ ] dog died right so it was like all of these things around me freshman year I'm just transitioning into school and it was very very early early days that I really realize holy [ __ ] man like everything can change in an instant like so immediate and it really framed a lot of the rest of my life and how important family is so do you you know on a day-to-day basis was all this stuff happening at home affecting how you were acting in school behaving in school keeping up with your work any any stuff like that oh I hated school I I I hated school so much I hated being in the classroom uh well I think I loved like seeing my friends you know I was always especially in elementary school getting red cards for you know talking to my friends in class being distracting I always tell this funny story that when I was in high school just to give the audience some perspective I was nominated for two nominations in our senior class you know there's like most likely to become an actor actress or like most likely to be successful no I didn't get any of those my two nominations were number one I got nominated as the class clown number two I got nominated as the teachers pest not the teacher's pet the teachers pest I won the teachers past so of all of the students in my entire grade I definitely acted out in class I liked being the funny kid I liked getting attention but what I hated the most was I hated learning things that I didn't care about I didn't like going to history I didn't like going to English classes even though I you know loved writing I didn't like I didn't like learning things I didn't like but when I was able to do things I loved like you know selling knives or or playing sports or or doing things like that I was just absolutely laser focused and I could spend hours and hours and hours just doing that one single thing you didn't get a most likely to start a pyramid scheme or anything like that after the thought oh hey it's still early I'm only 32 so I think you kind of answered this question in there in the teacher's past award but what are some other things that your teachers may have said about you when you were in high school I think that you know generally my teachers loved me like their it wasn't it wasn't a oh you know Shawn's a bad kid or like we don't like him it was just like man this kid has a TD like he is he's all over the place you know always talking her friends always you know jumping around doing you know sports and leading the team they would have said I definitely was a leader of the pack I loved being around people I think being team oriented has just always been a part of my persona but ultimately you know I I think that they wouldn't be too surprised like I have memories of Ginny tsofen Ginny if you're listening this I love you so much but we were in middle school in high school and this mom looked around all my friends were like oh you know Shawn just like he's not gonna do anything he's gonna do this you do that and Ginny would go and say you know Shawn is gonna be the most successful of your friends like you guys are gonna be working for Shawn one day and I don't know I think that that's stuck with me a long time that you know just because people put you into this box especially when you're young especially when you have all your friends and they're all like you're this or you're that or your parents are telling you you're this and you're that things like what Ginni talked to me about really put it into my mind that like you can change who you are you can start over and I think that's really what College was about for me was this chance to completely start over no one knew who I was no one knew my background they didn't know I was fat they didn't know I was skinny they didn't know I you know was a distracting kid they didn't know anything and I think that that was a huge moment was knowing that I could completely you know change kind of my past in order to make a better future so now we're at college and you were telling us a little bit about how you did not love school growing up so what led you to will say college generally and then more specifically to the University of Miami mm-hmm so I was one of those kids that never wanted to go to college I hated high school so much I hated going to class so much that the thought of continuing and going to school was crazy to me I was clearly the greatest knife salesman of all time I knew that if I just kept you know plugging away at this idea of business or sales or marketing or something that it would be more productive than me going to school and so I went to mom and I said mom I don't want to go to college and mom literally like spit up her coffee and you know she it was mandatory there is no optionality to whether or not I would go to school my mom believes so strongly in education so strongly in school she had the opportunity for her parents to help her pay for college she'd been saving her entire life for her children to go to college and so it just was not an option and she said listen you know you don't have to go to any school you don't want to go to but you have to get a college education and at the time my grades were nowhere near good enough to get into a USC or an LMU or you know a UCLA or anything like that uh and they were however good enough to get into a school called Marymount and Marymount is a two-year almost like a transitionary School where you go there are much smaller classrooms and the promise that Marymount gives is that they will help you get good grades they'll help you learn and achieve your ways so that you can actually transfer out of Marymount and go to one of these schools typically like LMU or USC and that became you know that became my my path is I was gonna go to school and once I got to college I immediately loved it you know I wish they would tell people more that you know once you get into college you get to choose your classes and you get to learn you know lots of different things and be around these you know amazing people and you know it was just such like a new chapter going to Marymount and I really fell fond of both marketing in psychology I had many opportunities to try different types of classes but these were the two that really felt like the most close to my heart and there was a time you know certainly in the first six eight months of going to school that I thought I want to be a therapist like I loved psychology I love helping people that have similar to myself gone through these struggles or gone through these personal you know trials and tribulations and maybe I could help you know take someone that was depressed or take someone that had schizophrenia or was bipolar and I could help them kind of you know build a deeper perspective or something and I remember being in class and talking to my professor at the time and telling him that you know someday I want to be like a psychiatrist I want to be the person helping these people when they're at their hardest times and he asked me a question and he said how does it feel or how do you feel about taking your work home with you and it was a very interesting way he said it because you know as an entrepreneur and as a founder I love working at home I'm someone that you know when I'm passionate about something I've become so laser focused but you know he really spent time not telling me to do it or not telling me not to do but just helping me understand what could potentially be the future of doing this and he said that you know when you're meeting these people and you're trying to help them it's really hard to separate what you do at work and what you do at home and for me it definitely is like I'm you know when I throw myself into something it's it's all in and and I really thought a lot about like do I want to be going home on a weekend and thinking about someone that might commit suicide or think about someone that is so horribly depressed they don't know how to get themselves out and I thought you know while I love psychology and I love helping people I think that I want to live a more positive a more you know creative lifestyle and I ended up deciding that I really want to go into business marketing advertising really anything that could potentially let me make money and use my creativity and it was at marymount that I had the chance to go and visit my cousin Mike who I know is listening to this over at the University of Miami and man for anyone that's ever done and checked out um his campus it is contagious from the moment you step on that campus I mean Steve you know you're have one of the nicest biggest swimming pools with a huge diving board there's two bars on campus students were drinking beers you know beautiful weather almost every day it was so different from what I had done my entire life and no one knew who I was and going there and being with my cousin and seeing this opportunity I thought this is where I'm going I don't need to apply anywhere else I applied to one school at him out of Marymount and that was the University of Miami I somehow was able to get in and the rest is history you know Miami was man Miami was so incredible for so many reasons but I think the biggest one was just the opportunity to start fresh and I think that for anyone that has been you know dealing with a a year two years three years of kind of being in that funk or being in this sort of the same thing over and over again when you change your environment right like they know Tony Robbins talks a lot about this like when you're depressed you need to change your environment you need to go for a walk you need to jump into an ice-cold pool or the ocean and Steve I would imagine it was the same for you in Buffalo like when you're conditioned to just be doing the same thing moving into a different environment was like a catalyst for creating a new identity or new persona and so I was you know I just couldn't be more excited to start fresh where no one knew who I was no one knew my past no one knew what I was capable of and that gave me the opportunity you know to start my next chapter I'll just quickly comment on the the therapists thing and say that I think I'm not the only person who probably when they're at that moment where they don't know what the in the world they want to do or are faced with two completely different decisions they look at their phone and think I'll call Sean that seems like the right thing to do now let's uh let's talk through with with Sean so however much of that psychology training you you did do worked Lizabeth so you got to Miami you know you had your cousin your cousin Mike there so you had a great cheerleader sort of built in can you talk a little bit though because when I first met you I was sort of confused because you you were coming from London so what what was going on there hair how is it that you went from Marymount to London to Miami so this idea of a study abroad semester was something no one had ever told me about in high school I I was unaware that you could go to school and also travel and when I found out when I got into Marymount that the only thing holding you back from traveling the world and going to all of these countries was you had to have at least a 3.6 GPA that became the motivator for me to do better in school I applied to get into the study abroad pro it happened to be in London and you know going to London back to that topic of kind of starting over and transitioning marymount was only a couple miles away from my house right it was in Palos Verdes every weekend I would go and either see my parents I would go and see my friends at USC UCLA so I still hadn't started this next chapter but when I went to London and I went to Europe I was able to start fresh I knew absolutely no-one I remember I went to Europe with my mom she took me there we started by going to Prague together we got absolutely just shit-faced together drinking booze hanging out I was 19 20 years old at the time and just having the best time with my mom and we traveled to this small little town called Czech Booya vich I'm sure I'm ruining this right now to visit a family friend and while we were in Czech bouya vich we walked into a market and the alcohol in the market was like two or three dollars for a bottle of vodka or a bottle of rum or whatever and so I literally bought a suitcase an entire suitcase and filled the suitcase up with about 40 bottles of alcohol I'm not exaggerating 40 maybe an entire suitcase so when I got to my school in London my thought process was I'm gonna throw the parties I've been you know going from Manhattan Beach to Marymount I was going to these USC frat parties seeing how they were doing and I'm thinking okay I get it you got to be the guy throwing the party if you want to be the one making the friends and so when I got there I would invite all the students into our room we'd be poppin bottles we'd be having a good time but it you know again there's so many of listeners to this that you grow up with your friends from middle school elementary school high school and it's part of that culture growing up or you got to dig at each other it's constantly you know you'll say oh I think Kobe Bryant is the best bad so player and your friends will almost immediately say no it's Michael Jordan or you'll say you know my favorite color is green and they say that's a stupid color it's brown but it was this constant growing up of trying to prove yourself trying to one-up your friends but when you transition into this place where no one knows you you have none of that kind of original banter or anything going on it changed the dynamic and it was it was lighter it wasn't so much about proving everyone that I was right and they were wrong it was just about building it was about making a community and meeting new friends and you know traveling it's something that is so incredible because every corner that you turn is a brand new experience and your brain is just taking in these experiences and it's so it's such such a different place especially when you grow up in Manhattan Beach here in this small town you see the same people the same things now to transition almost every single weekend for five six months traveling to new country Ireland Germany Spain Greece Scotland you know so many amazing places and I was doing it all on my own no parents there you know with my friends doing my thing that you know it was in Greece I I remember this very very specifically were in Greece in Santorini driving ATV scooters all around the island Spencer spinner if you're listening this to love you guys driving these ATVs all around the island I've got my my earbuds in not air pods at the time these are wired and I've got my earbuds in and I'm listening to the Red Hot Chili Peppers this song called wet sand so if any of you guys want to turn on wet sand from Red Hot Chili Peppers to get your mind in this world here but there's a part of the song where I was just like holy [ __ ] I am riding an ATV on top of a mountain in Greece with my very best friends listening to music wind blowing through my hair and I felt you know I'm even getting chills right now thinking about it it was full serotonin no drugs no alcohol just living life the feeling of street living and I knew right then that traveling was it like traveling was the destination traveling was where I needed to keep getting to how the [ __ ] would I be able to travel if I was working a desk job or working 9:00 to 5:00 or I can't do that I have to keep doing this I need to make my own money I need to travel and see the world so when I got out of got out of London while I was there I found out that I got accepted to Miami and when I got back to Miami everything was around travel I have to start a business I have to make money so that I can go and do this more and even today you know been this year was in Bali was in Europe every year try to take one or two trips because it allows me to reset you know I regardless even if it's just for a couple of days you don't need to change your environment for months or years even a couple of days can totally reset you can totally ground you and um you know that's my London story leading up to the University of Miami so now now we're at Miami you know I know you you joined a fret you joined our soccer team you you know obviously taking classes finding new places to live all that at what point while living in Miami did you say okay yeah I'm going to school but now I need to start a business I want to have a business going on right now well I think it started even the summer leading up to Miami so I was in I was in the I was in London for six months in first semester then it got into you know we had our summer break and during summer break I had an internship working at a company called 1-800 dentist and before 1/800 dentist even I was very early on Facebook and Twitter and you know they had only come out a couple years prior so it was still the very early days of building a community or a follower or a page these things were only out for months if not a year or two at the time and so I really became interested in this concept of building communities or followers but when I got to college I really wanted to expand that I was like freedom there is no professors telling me what I could or couldn't do and so I did what many young entrepreneurs do these days I turned to the Internet and I went on Google and I started looking up like who who is in this space who knows what they're talking about and I stumbled upon people like Chris Brogan I don't even know if Chris Brogan is still in the game but this guy talked about you know the importance of building a community without asking for anything in return creating content writing blogs providing value to people before asking for anything in return and it really you know changed my dynamic of this concept of social media and growth and I had the opportunity you know I don't know how I came across Gary Vaynerchuk it must have been you know either somehow online I I still to this day remember one of his I think it was like a real estate or real one of his real estate speaking gigs that just really stuck with me at the time and he came out with this book called crush it and crush it was really about how like if you have a passion if you if you are a passionate person you can put every ounce of energy in and you know every ounce of your will into this thing and in today's world with the internet you can actually turn your passions into business and it was such a different message from that that you hear you know growing up like there's so many times your friends tell you like oh you can't do this you can't do that and I had already been you know kind of conditioned with my friend saying oh you're too fat for this you're too fat for that and so there was something about this book that really lit a fire under my ass and I mean you know you were living with me at the time it was almost this obsessive quest to find what was next and you know it started really if if you think about the lines of crushing it all talked about you know lead into your passion do what your passion and at the time I was passionate about my fedora hats I was passionate about my outfits at about you know redefining who I was in one of the ways that I was redefining who I was losing my look right and so I just got to Miami Miami has that Latin flavor to it and I thought that fedora hats were the coolest thing in the world like if you remember Steve on almost a nightly basis we would go out to the bars and I'd be wearing this fedora hat and all my friends hated it I remember because I just hoped that we wouldn't get beat up yes and so the Fedora was something that I thought oh this is cool this makes me stand out this makes me you know different than all of the other kids and I was losing weight I was getting healthier I was playing on the soccer team so I was really building myself up and at the exact same time as me getting there thinking about what do I want to do you know I'm reading these books on business entrepreneurship I read this one book called the long tail and for any of you that have never picked up the long tail it's it's a really interesting book because it talks about this concept how you have Barnes and Noble you have blockbuster you have Walmart you have these retail brick-and-mortar establishments and there's one thing in common of all of these different retail stores they have limited space you don't have endless amounts of shoes to put in a store or books to put in a store you only have limited space and what fundamentally changed about the internet is it created unlimited space you could have unlimited inventory whereas Blockbuster could only have the top let's call it thousand videos in the store what about the other 10 million videos Barnes & Noble could only have you know 20,000 books but what about the other 2 billion that exists out there and so the internet created this opportunity for unlimited variations you could have you know you could have blue and green and red and yellow and you can have any color any size any anything and the the internet created the storefront and so I started thinking how can I take my passion around style and fedoras and clothing and turn it into an actual business and boom that's when it hits me Nike ID had just come out for shoes you could actually go online and build your own shoes and I thought what if what if I could go online and build my own Fedora and that moment of like whoa I'm gonna give away this opportunity for people to make customized fedora hats so next step is I've got to get some fedoras where am I going to get the fedoras I don't know anyone that has fedoras so I go to ebay I purchase about I don't know 15 or 24 guards I don't know I don't remember if you remember them coming to the house but UPS truck comes they they drop off you know a couple dozen or whatever fedora hats and I start trying them all on one at a time zero of the fedoras fit my head none of them and I thought to myself [ __ ] this is not gonna work I'm gonna have to ship all of these back there's all the shipping costs to get them here the unit economics were not working out and that was before I even thought about how I was gonna build the website or what I was gonna do and so I thought I can't do fedoras what else could I do that maybe is kind of similar and at the time I had this pair of pink and yellow sunglasses that my girlfriend at the time had given me there are those like cheap Wayfarer style you know very inexpensive $10 glasses that you know everyone finds at you know either a mall or in Venice Beach or whatever you all know what I'm talking about but the difference was I wanted to let people build them themselves I didn't want to give you a selection say hey here's the 10 colors or the 30 colors I wanted to provide an experience where anyone could build anything they wanted if you wanted a purple frame with a white ear and a pink ear great if you wanted to have orange and green sunglasses for football games great if you were a student at University of Wisconsin and you wanted to go in the bookstore and buy a pair of red glasses great so what I wanted to do is create unlimited variety in sunglasses but allow the customers to choose themselves and that was where Playfair came so at the time university of miami launches or had a business competition their elevator pitch competition first prize got $20,000 and I said I am going to freaking crush this pitch and I go in I made it past the first round I get into the finals and I don't know if you remember this Steve but there is a night before the night before the the pitch competition all of my friends are going out to the bar they're all partying and you know you come up to see hey Sean are you gonna come out with us no way man I'm studying my pitch I'm getting this thing down I'm visualizing the victory and tomorrow I'm gonna go and I'm gonna take the W and that next day I went in and I pitched my ass off you know I just I had it down and took the room over and I won the business competition at you um and my university actually seed funded me twenty thousand dollars to get started one of my best friends happen to live in Beijing China and helped me source my first products and maybe three months after that maybe ten fifteen thousand sunglasses showed up in Miami in boxes you know had a whole slew of problems getting them through customs and getting them delivered but at the end of the day they showed up and so the one thing that you know I think about Cutco days is I have no problem walking going door-to-door you know I learned the importance of you know if you want to sell something it's a numbers game you got to talk to a hundred people before you get five of them to purchase so I basically just went door to door to the fraternities the sororities I walked around with a little clipboard and I said hey you know write down what kind of frame color what kind of ear color whatever you want and I'm gonna make them for you and then that transitioned into hiring my frat brothers we did on-campus events we sold into book stores but play fair was an opportunity for me to build this new identity right I had gone from the fat kid and gotten in elementary school and the distracting kid in high school to now I'm in college and I was the sunglasses guy I remember there was a feature on you in our student newspaper and you're sitting there in a Miami basketball jersey wearing sunglasses with a hundred pairs of sunglasses around you and I I always felt like you loved having the label of sunglasses guy that you you know from you know even that point when we were 20 or 21 that you so deeply identified with the business that you were building a hundred percent I I think that it has to do like I'm an all-in guy when I am when I'm all-in whether it's on my friendships my relationships my business you know I've we've had guests on the podcast before talk about work life harmony you know not as much about the balance but the harmony I think I'm constantly seeking that harmony and I love making my business my persona and you know I can't you know I can't emphasize enough the feeling that you have you know walking on campus as a 21 year old student on like a Saturday for game day right like every Saturday all the students everyone I know would be going to football games we'd be loading up into buses and you'd look around and there would quite literally be thousands and thousands of students walking around the football stadium wearing my sunglasses trading them giving them to their friends and you know that that feeling of like wow I created this with I sold these with my own two bare hands here it was infectious it was something that I longed for and you know it's something that even to this day I think people look at me and go oh yeah Sean coefficient labs like he's he's in it man there's there's no there's blinders on right I'm I am all in and I think it just has to do with I really do associate you know put put myself into whatever it is it really becomes you know it becomes me I took you know coefficient labs you've now had four five six years five years now how long did play ferret last and what happened so play fair you know launched my junior year of college I ran a junior year I ran its senior year I ran its super senior year because I was a transfer student in and around the super super senior right after that last year I - looked around and I was like damn all my friends are gone you know I'm like 23 now I don't really know if I want to sell shitty sunglasses to freshmen and sophomores that I don't even know anymore you know it lost that that appeal of going to the I didn't even want to go to the football games anymore I didn't know anyone and so I think there was a moment where I thought man like I definitely am good salesman but I don't think I've got this whole business thing down yet like I didn't really have any employees I was storing all the money I was making week to week under my mattress I would have twelve thousand dollars fourteen thousand stupid amounts of money just stuffed under a mattress and I didn't really have any of the frameworks for building a real team and so my mentality was I'm gonna box all these sunglasses up I'm gonna ship them back to California and I'm gonna start fresh I'm gonna go to UCLA I'm gonna go to USC I'm gonna start to build my sunglasses business back home where I can kind of you know get back to neutral again like I said before all my friends my peers everyone was already gone at the time so I sort of felt like I was alone out in Miami selling these sunglasses that I wasn't too excited about anymore that I wanted to start fresh and so I moved everything to California moved in with one of my best best friends into an apartment and the the mentality at the time this is back in around 2012 the mentality at the time was you know I'm gonna start fresh like I'm starting this up again like there's nothing stopping me and around that same time Instagram had just come out maybe a year before that it had come out so Instagram is very new very early I love taking pictures I loved being on that platform and as I'm scrolling down on Instagram I see that one of the guys that I followed his name's quickie Dave temple a hundred thousand plus followers early influencer for Instagram and he made a post that said you can buy my photography on instagram as canvas art and I thought whoa that is [ __ ] awesome you're telling me that I could take a picture and someone could actually buy that that piece of photography I want to check this out and I found out that it was a company in Santa Monica in Los Angeles called insta canvas so I go I do a little research to see what's going on in insta canvas had actually recently been accepted to what was called an accelerator program called mucker mucker labs I had never even heard of an accelerator program before but I thought man like sunglasses are fun but Wow wouldn't it be cool to join a team that like knows what they're doing and they're working on Instagram and they like do this cool stuff and so I look at my roommate I'm sitting on the couch I see this photo I look at him I go Kevin I am working at this company and I leave I go into my backyard I took a camera out put it on a tripod and basically filmed myself telling the CEO of this company why he should hire me you know I started this company selling sunglasses on the best sales guy I love Instagram all these reasons and I tweeted the CEO and I said you know hey I've just created this video I hope you'll take a look at it a week or two later he sends me an email back I got an interview and the next thing you know I was hired as one of the I was team member number six at insta canvas and how long did you stay at insta canvas so I'll talk about you know that in a second but but before going into the length of the of the job itself I think it's important to set the context of like what it was like to be at insta canvas or in in mucker you know there's so many students like me that you know they're they've got a couple of buddies and friends they want to start a business they start hustling and they start going for it but they don't really know what it's like to be a part of like a real accelerator program I definitely didn't but when I went for the first time and you see you know ten different companies all working under the same roof together you know CEOs designers technologists marketing people I was obsessed I thought it was the cool this thing you you just are around this energy in it coming from a selling sunglasses out of my apartment to now being in this space where everyone is pumping each other up and you know my CEO Matt Munson to me at the time just out of school he was like a god you know Matt did this thing that he called stand-up or every day the team would get into a circle and we would do what was called stand up and we would talk about you know what we're working on for that day and what we're excited about and it would go around in a circle and Matt would tell us that you know today I'm meeting with first round capital I'm meeting with benchmark I'm reading I'm meeting all these amazing VCS and I was like holy [ __ ] this is so cool I really looked to Matt like he was like a Steve Jobs s character the way he brought us in the way he focused us on growth and at the time insta canvas was if not the fastest growing startup one of the fastest growing startups in the LA ecosystem thousands tens of thousands of new users coming daily and weekly and at the time you know I was just fresh with ideas and energy and I'm getting paid something like two hundred and fifty bucks a week pretty much barely able to survive but my level of happiness and excitement and passion was like a thousand times what it could even I could have even anticipated because I was back on that team right it was going from being all alone to being a part of this squad and every everywhere I turned the guys were more talented than than the you know than the one next to them and I put everything into it I said like this is it this is my is my family now it's my squad and began you know chipping away at their social I went to Matt the CEO and I said hey I built my entire sunglasses business selling sunglasses on campus I know Facebook I know Twitter I know all these channels I can help us grow and so they sort of put it into my head that if I do a really really good job for them I maybe someday could be the director of growth and I was like factor of growth what the [ __ ] is that and this is like 2013 around that year for any marketers listening to this this is around when oh my gosh what is his name from qual my god qual Aroo Sean Ellis boom this is the year around that time Sean ELLs coined the term growth hacker okay this is around 2013 that this it wasn't even a thing before this but growth hacker and so all of the new startups were hiring for growth and I thought whoa like that sounds really cool I want to do that there's a little bit of media a little bit of creative a little bit of you know data all of these things kind of thrown together in a you know whether it was growth or user acquisition I just knew that's what I wanted to be and I thought to myself man like if I put a hundred percent of myself into this if I just go all-in I'm gonna get this Ruhlman to be this person and and I did I put I put everything into it I was working six days a week sometimes seven I would go in on the weekends I you know would post up this is a beautiful office in Santa Monica by the beach and they put so much trust in me they gave me so much room to do my thing that I would have done it for free I would have done it I would have paid to be there that's how much I loved being on this on this squad and after about four or five months Matt the CEOs going every week going to new investor meetings going to new investor means and then finally boom he raises our seed round the first like two to four hundred thousand dollar seed round this is something that like every day during stand-up were we're always trying to see like are we gonna get the funding are we gonna get the funny and then he does it and matt says guys we are going to celebrate together we're gonna go to Las Vegas we're gonna ball out we're gonna have an amazing time and at that moment that's solidified it for me like I go Tom with this ship like this is the most fun I've ever had we went to Vegas we had such a blast we went to this amazing dinner and we got drinks and we danced and we did all like just everything you'd want to do Vegas and we get home and the very first we got home let's say on a Sunday so that Monday I get back into the office Monday to Friday I'm on my a-game I like the ideas coming out the data everything is is is amazing and we had the biggest week of growth we'd ever had at the company was the week we got back from Las Vegas so I'm feeling good I'm feeling like re-energized from Vegas I come back in on Monday the second week after we get back and Matt calls me into his office and I go to sit down at the office Matt is sitting right across from me I see Todd who is the CEO I was sitting right to my right and Matt looks at me and he says Shawn you are such an amazing team member we we love having you here you work so hard you have so much passion and energy but unfortunately you know we've been talking to the board and we need to bring on a director of growth or director of user acquisition that has more experience than you do I'm very very sorry but today is unfortunately your last day working here at ins to canvas [Music] you",

    "transcript": "What I'm looking for in a founder is I'm looking for repeat exceptionalism. You may have never done anything business related before. You could have been dealt the crappiest hand when you were born, but somehow you made it to some of the top schools and performed very well there. You figured out how to support your family without having a degree. You're showing that you can persevere. You can figure it out. What's up everybody and welcome to the newest episode of Demo Day, the podcast for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists where we demystify the culture of joining one of the top accelerators, incubators or VC funds around the world. I'm your host Sean Goldfan from Coefficient Labs and on today's show we'll be interviewing Marlon Nichols, managing partner at Mac Venture Capital. Without further ado, let's get into demo day. [Music] Marlin, thank you so much for joining us today on Demo Day. Yeah. No, it's great to be back. So, Marlin, I got to start, you know, uh we're a couple months out now from LA Tech Week and, uh, it's always been really cool to see Mac part of the ecosystem of LA Tech Week, SF Tech Week. you guys have always been um you know in that ecosystem but putting on the culture house event and you know integrating both Mac and culture house and bringing everyone together having the chance to go and participate and just be at your guys's event with you at tech week. Uh it was so cool to see you I think just put together one of like the most premier events of the entire um LA Tech Week ecosystem. And so I just wanted to ask you like from your perspective, what was the most memorable part of that experience and that night? Uh well, first of all, thank you. Um you know, the team works really hard at uh trying to put together uh like a great event, right, with the with the perfect mix of founders, investors, executives, etc. It's not easy work, but they they pull it off. So, um I'm sure they'll appreciate hearing you say that when this comes out. Um, my favorite part, um, I it's it's really all of it, right? It's just watching the, um, the connections happen, right? Watching founders meet investors, watching investors, um, connect for the first time or even catch up and figure out how they can do more together. Like, that's that's really what um, that's the essence of of Culture House, right? It's it's supposed to be a fun environment, right? The music is great, the drinks are flowing, you know, there's some content, but it's really about the connections. So watching it like come to life and and seeing those things um happen, that's the best part of it for me. That's why I do it. And now having the experience now of you know both investing in LA, being a part of startups that are in San Fran, in New York, in Africa, all over the place like what do you think makes the LA startup ecosystem different than some of the other cities or some of the other tech hubs? What have you noticed over these last, you know, 5 10 years that you've been really invested in the community here? Yeah, I think the thing that stands out the most about the LA community or differentiates it the most is that it's very collaborative. The investment community is very collaborative and and I think the reason for that is um where this ecosystem started, right? I I think you know there were a lot of small funds and um and angel investors that would come together to you know um help a founder raise their seed round right because there weren't funds of scale to just um write a $3 million check or $4 million check five six by themselves right and so it was a group effort it was very collaborative and so now you fast forward um to today where you have funds like ours and um Vikica and um upfront and um um Bonfire and um Crosscut, etc., that can write, you know, those um $3 million uh checks in a seed round. But there's a there's a a learned um habit, right, of working with really good people that can add value beyond what you and your firm typically do. And so, you've been on the journey with them before and you want to be on the journey with them again. So that that um element of um or that spirit of uh of collaboration just continues and um you know as those funds are viewed as the leaders of the ecosystem um you know that kind of mentality just trickles down to the the newer players um that are popping up in in in the ecosystem. And so you just have a um a very communal and and collaborative environment here in LA. What do you want to see more of next year? You know, LA Tech Week in particular has been through such an evolution from year 1 to year 2 to year 3. I think this was by far the biggest, most spread out year. It still felt like what was so cool about Culture House and your event was that it it felt like the most like central place of all the events I went to. It was like the people there, the community there, and just everyone being together at one like amazing location. The food, the music, like everything you guys did was so cool. What do you want to see for next year? Whether it's for your own event personally or just for the community at large, how do you want to continue to see LA Tech Week evolve over these next couple years? Yeah, I think for for Culture House specifically, I want to see people that I haven't seen there before, right? I want to see some investors that have never been to a to a Culture House. I want to see founders that um we're not familiar with, right, come in and and have the experience and join the community. Community now is about I think 20,000 um people. And so, you know, I I'm I'm interested to to see that grow um and and what, you know, kind of new participants um how they will impact the the community. From a a broader um LA Tech Week perspective, I I think it's much of the same, right? I want to see more participation from um from the venture firms. I want to see more collaborations across events, right? Um more more firms doing events together. um you know and I think we did a a decent job of um uh just kind of double clicking or really emphasizing the um the economies or the sectors that are really strong for LA like aerospace and and defense you know e-commerce like they were there were various events that you know really focus on those things AI is everywhere but there were obviously AI events um so yeah I I think those are the things that I that I would like to see and just like to watch it keep growing and and even for folks that aren't from LA to um come in and and join the experience because you know the founders that are you know raising um later stage funding like it would be great to have some of these multi-stage firms um be more a part of um you know of the of the process and and the environment. Now Marlin before we dig deep from you know into what founders and investors can learn from your journey and how you've navigated I think just to set a little bit of context I talk about you know culture house I'm talking about Mac ventures could you spend just maybe a minute explaining to the audience that has never been to a culture house event or this is the first time maybe they're hearing about like what is culture house and then we can kind of transition into Mac and the sort of just general startups that you guys work with and look into. I I think I'd love to produce a little bit of context and then start to kind of pull back some of the layers of the onion, if you will. Yeah, sure. So, uh you know, Culture House, I I think we are going on 10 years old now. Um it's an events company um that I co-founded with uh an entrepreneur that I invested in um many years ago um back when I was at Intel Capital um guy named Rodney Williams. Uh his company at the time was was Listener. He now helps run another startup called um Solo Funds and it's a fintech um peer-to-peer um lending marketplace essentially. Uh but we were we would go to uh various conferences and um there was just a void of uh events within the event if you if you would like um whether it be a party, whether it be panels, etc. that felt um diverse in nature and looked diverse in nature, right? And what I mean by when I say diverse, I don't mean like everyone there is black, right? Or everyone there is Latina, right? I mean you have white, black, Asian, men, women, all you know, it it just feels very inviting, right, and fun. Um but also it it is productive because um while being diverse it's in um from a a racial and gender perspective it's also diverse from a what do you do perspective right so you have the investors you have the founders early stage founders you have later stage founders you have corporate executives you have government officials you have celebrities um professional um athletes etc all just like mixed into this uh into this thing and you're just watching the magic happen. And so, um, we've been doing this for for about 10 years and and really it's about just creating these environments that can be productive for a very diverse audience on the backdrop of other conferences, right? So, um, LA Tech Week is the one we're talking about now, but we also do it as a part of Art Basle, um, South by Southwest, Afro, which has become, um, probably one of the largest, um, gatherings for for Culture House. um Marthur's Vineyard during the um the month of August as well as um we're looking at um can um France this year. So, wow. Yeah. So, so that's so that's um that's what it is and and and how it was how it was founded and um it's just grown tremendously over the years. Now, this is going to sound like a really silly question, especially, you know, I feel like, you know, for anyone that's, you know, I I don't know what the right age number is. 30 years old, 40 years old, whatever it is, like we grew up going to conferences, going to events, go like that was just like part of at least my experience in coming up in startups. And then during co everything kind of went away. there weren't these in-person events and I feel like a lot of the high school college students that were in COVID, they never really got through that process of like going to events and hustling on the weekends and learning about all these different in-person activities and now we've got, you know, the 20somes that are coming up. Maybe they haven't actually been to an event or they don't understand why is it so important. I have social media. I could just, you know, build my following online. What sort of advice do you have for the younger, you know, gen or even people that have been to events, but you know, it's been a couple years and they've kind of written them off. Why is it important now to come back together again? And what, you know, where do you see that playing a role in in startup founders just growth in general? Yeah, I you know you can you know listen to podcasts, you can um research things on on the internet, but what you can't manufacture are are serendipitous moments, right? And and that's what you get um at live events, right? So, you don't know um who you're going to be able to run into and have a really interesting conversation and where that conversation might go from there. That's why that's why you go, right? Um you um you might end up in a in a crop circle where um you're able to learn from folks that are, you know, doing similar things to you um or maybe at a similar point in their founder journey as you are, right? um you can't really you can't manufacture that um online, right? Um I mean, I guess you could have things like Discord and you know, and and go to places like that, but um not everyone um is is is going to be there and not everyone's going to be as open as if they when they meet you in person and you have uh you spark a true connection. So, so that's what I would say. It's, you know, and listen, it's not for everyone, right? Um, you have some extreme introverts out there that, you know, going to something like that is just too overwhelming, and that's and that's fine. Um, but I would I'd argue that, you know, I've met some really interesting people um at, you know, at at different events. And and the one piece of advice that I would give to them is just figure out which conferences, which events make the most sense for you, which ones you think you'll be um most productive at, get the most out of. See the the um the people that you want to be around, etc., and and and try to attend those. Yeah. It's so funny you said that because I'm having a flashback of our interview together from a couple years ago where you were talking about uh how you thought about your MBA program and how like you didn't just apply to every MBA program. You were really intentional about the specific programs you were going to apply to and why you were applying to them. And like it seems like you've always been really good at reverse engineering these amorphous things like going to an event and just asking the most logical question of like why am I going and what am I trying to get out of it? And um I think that's such good advice because sometimes you can just get thrown into like oh I'm supposed to go to events but not taking the time to really say like am I in the right fishing pond you know is this the best use of my time energy and it can almost almost be like a crutch where you're like oh I'll just go to the event but you don't end up actually moving the puck forward. Um that's really really interesting. Now transitioning into just Mac Ventures again I think like a lot of this podcast today I want to um talk more from the context of like you know advice you're giving to these founders these investors but I still think it's important for people to know who you are who your fund is the types of people that you want to resonate into your ecosystem. So maybe talk a little bit about MAC, you know, the types of startups you like to invest in and, you know, potentially like the size checks that typically are like the right fit for what you're what you guys are doing. Yeah. So, uh, Mac is a seedstage venture firm, right? And, um, seed is defined in a number of different ways by different people, right? For for us, it typically means that you've built a product um, you're ready to take it to market or you've recently taken it to market. in most cases that's what it means for us. Um and we like to invest there because um our backgrounds um you know consulting um talent management um politics um and um you know uh leading uh kind of business development and implementation for a startup. um all the I think the through line um between all those professions is that you've got to be able to tell a story that really resonates with a specific audience, right? It's it's it's sales, it's go to market, right? And when a company is at what we define a seed um a seed company as or in that stage that we define as a seed stage company, um that's what they need to do. They need to take this product that they built and bring it to market. And so given our backgrounds, we we believe we're really good at helping companies to craft that story and figure out how best to tell it to a very specific audience and take that product to market. So that's why Seed for us um we we're a generalist fund, right? Um but we we like to say we're a generalist fund run by um sector um experts, right? So um I started my professional career in software. So most of the deals that I will do are related to to to software, right? It could be deep tech software, it could be B2B software, um software for consumer, right? Um my partner Mike has carved carved out a space um within aerospace and defense and and and really hard tech, right? So so that's which LA is now starting to really blossom in. Yeah. Yeah. So so we do a lot of deals in in in those areas. And then um my third partner, Adrian, he's more of a um uh he's like a more of a true generalist. So he's kind of outside of the box of of me and Mike, but um what he's really good at is identifying talent and um picking founders um that you know can transcend, right? Uh so generalist fund um but we have some core areas that that we we gravitate to, right? So I mentioned fintech, um health, um health tech, aerospace, defense, um deep tech generally. We're we're jumping into energy now. Um we're looking at some uh fision companies and and things like that. Um marketplaces, logistics companies. That's where um we we spend most of our time. Um a little bit of our time is in kind of the media and entertainment space, platforms. um and and we have some uh some web 3 companies as well but that's where you can you can see us spending most of our times in terms of a sector um geographically uh primarily North America um but somewhere between somewhere around 10% of our investments um will be Africa Latam um right now that's that's meant Mexico um and um I think we have a couple companies in the UK yeah I'm excited to ask you later on in the podcast about your philosophy around investing internationally. I think like at least for me as a founder, there's always that thought around like, oh, we can expand to Europe or to to these places, but then you get into the logistics of it, and you're like, wait, how the hell are we actually going to do that? So, it's it's really uh cool to hear how you've navigated that and I'm I'm excited to ask you more about it. to kind of come back to that founder side. You mentioned that, you know, once a founder has built a product, you're really there to like help them bring it to market and help facilitate that sort of growth. When you have a, you know, founder, maybe they're even a little too early for Mac. they're too early for you and they come to you and they say, \"Hey, I have this really great idea, but I don't know if I should try to build the idea first and then try to raise money or if I should try to raise some money and then build the quote unquote idea or the product.\" What do you say to them? You know, I would imagine that like that comes to you in different realms where some people have this amazing idea and then you ask for them to show you some product and they don't have it. What you know, what do you say to someone that's kind of in that chicken or the egg? Do I leave my job and go and build this thing or do I try to raise money first while I've got the job and then build the thing? Yeah. I I wouldn't be so bold as to um tell someone what to do with their life, right? Um what I will say though is that ideas come a dime a dozen, right? Everyone can have an idea. Um what you do with that idea um you know if you can bring that idea to fruition, you know, now we have something to talk about. So, I don't I'm not going to advi I don't know what your life situation is. So, I'm not going to advise you to leave your job and go build this thing. Um, but if you want someone to take you seriously, you have to figure out how to build it or some instance of it, right? You've got to show that you're that you are serious about this and that you're capable. Um, and you know, before that, you're just like everyone else walking the streets. And so what signals show a founder, not the VC, but show a founder that they're ready, you know, because when you're really early, that sort of like I don't know where I should be going, but I feel like I'm on to something, but I'm not exactly sure cuz what is important to one founder maybe is not as important to another. So in your opinion, what signals should early stage founders be thinking to themselves that let them know, okay, now I'm ready to go and get investment. It depends on risk appetite honestly. Um, you know, there there's some folks that just they wake up and they have conviction and that's enough for them to to go and and go off and and and create this thing, right? There are other folks where, you know, they might need to prove that there's a market here, right? So, um they they find ways to test whether or not, you know, there is a market for this, that their um target customer will want this, right? Um it's it's hard to say, right? It's it's personal choice. It's risk appetite. It's a great answer because it is really case by case and you know, everyone has that a different appetite and and like you said before, different personal means for how long they could go, you know, in that direction. Uh when it comes to founders at the seed stage, a lot of what I've heard is that VCs bet more of like the jockey, not the horse, per se, where like they really are betting on the founder, the team that they're building cuz they know that like the idea is going to keep changing and the product will change and evolve over time. But how important is that founder's long-term vision versus like, you know, where where we're at today pitching the VC? Like now, you know, 10 years ago or 20 years ago, having a 10-year roadmap was, you know, part of the game, but now things are moving so quickly. Do you like seeing a longer term vision like that? Do you think it's more important that founders are coming to you with a tighter, you know, one year, two year, threeear map? like where do you want to see the specifics of some founders's vision um in today's you know society? Yeah, I've got to believe that the thing that you're attempting to build um can be a multi-billion dollar outcome, right? For the venture math to make sense, I have to believe that. And so it's not my job to um to to figure that out. It's the founders's job to show me that there is a path um towards this thing. And yeah, I've got to believe that. Now, you said something that um is also true like the the jockey is the most important um you know, piece of the equation, but you know um you don't hire a jockey if there's no horse, right? So, you know, um I you know, you got to believe that this founder has what it takes to build this thing that they're attempting to build. But also, if the market shifts and the thing that, you know, we all agreed that we were going to build is no more or or cannot be, I also have to believe that this founder um has what it takes to figure out what that thing that he should or or she should be building is. Yeah. You you used a term lot like a Mac down a you know, Mac truck down a culdeac. Exactly. Yeah. Like just blow through the walls and just make [ __ ] happen. Um, how do you personally develop a framework to evaluate these sorts of startups? Like do have you over the years have a system in place? Is it change every time? Like how with all of the moving pieces that are, you know, constantly happening, how are you able to take all of these uncertainties into your own mindset and sort of parse them out? Do you have any sort of framework that you run founders through when you're investing them or thinking about investing in them? There's a lot of things. Um and it, you know, it it just comes with with time, right? You you see a bunch of things. Um you see a um you know, a founder archetype and um you kind of in your head you're like, \"Okay, this person's going to is probably going to do these types of things, right?\" And um you know if it's not appropriate for them to do that, do I believe that they have the humility to listen to why they shouldn't do that and and change course? Right? It's just things you learn over over time. But you know what I'm looking for in in a founder is I'm looking for um repeat exceptionalism, right? like you've been outstanding at something or many things several times throughout your life, right? Because not just business related. It doesn't have to be business related. You you may have never done anything business related before, right? But I don't know, maybe you were a what the spelling be or like like the AC the accolades have to show exceptionalism. And it's not necessarily even accolade. It could just be living, right? You could have been dealt the crappiest hand when you were when you were born, but somehow you made it to some of the top schools and performed very well there. Or um you figured out how to how to support your family without having a a a degree and and did well and just, you know, and everyone has what they need because of you, right? You're you're showing that you can persevere. you can figure it out, right? That's and building a company is one of the hardest things that um a founder will ever do, a human will ever be able to do. And without that level of like conviction and commitment and resilience that you it's never going to get done, right? So, so that has to that has to be there front and center. I've got to believe in this founder, right? Um, from that perspective, I also have to believe that they're qualified to build the thing that they're that they're trying to build. So, are there, you know, is is there domain um expertise here? Um, is there just professional experience that, you know, you've seen something on the job and, you know, know this problem in and out and, you know, just have a novel um, uh, solution um, for that problem. Or maybe it's something you've lived a great portion of your life and you really know that problem. Taking care of a family member with a like whatever that thing might be, you just have an intimate knowledge around it. Yeah. Yeah. Like what are all the issues? What what do people that are in similar situations, what do they have to deal with every day and you know how to solve that for them, right? Like I'm looking for for things like that. Why are you uniquely qualified to build this thing that that you want to build, right? And then I'm looking for um uh for salesmanship. Doesn't have to be the CEO. It's got to be someone on the founding team, though. But you have to show me that you can sell because to build a company, you have to you have to sell to um uh prospective um uh employees. You've got to convince them to come on this journey with you because no one's ever built a company by themselves. not a successful one, right? So, can you attract um you know high quality talent and convince them to to join you? One, um can you actually sell a product, right? Whatever like companies sell things, right? Whether it's services or things, they're selling something, right? Can you do that? And then third, can you fund raise? Like I don't want to be the only investor on on on the cap table, right? When when things get difficult, I need to be able to share the burden. um when you know you come across a problem that I haven't seen yet um I want someone else in that room that can say oh you know what um we lived through this such and such time ago right so they got to be able to sell and then I I think there's got to be some level of technical aptitude on that founding team as well right um you know a lot of companies used to say well it's a tech enabled company we can outsource the the building of the um of of the tech right but the problem is if you don't have technical aptitude and and knowledge in house, you have no idea if what is being built for you is actually the right thing. And a lot of companies end up in tech debt because of that, right? Yeah. Which which maybe for those that are unfamiliar with tech debt, which is something that I only found out about a couple years ago once we started developing our own products, but can you just explain like what is tech debt for the untenical founder that maybe is like what is that? Yeah. So, I don't know, let's say you have to build this widget, right? And you you hire this team from wherever and and they're the technical team and they're building the widget for you, right? You you're spending all this all this money on it, right? Um and then it comes back and it's not it doesn't solve the problem you needed to solve and doesn't work how you need it to to work. So, now you have to spend more money to to then go go and fix that. And guess what? you're taking money from you you budgeted a certain amount, right, for the um for the technical development, right? You budgeted a certain amount for sales. You budgeted a certain amount for this and that and the third, right? Um and now you're having to pull from uh another place in in you know in that budget to continue to finance something that should have been um built the first time around. Yeah. And and that can also include things that are like um like not specific to that piece of technology but things that tie into it where it's like oh you now need to host it on AWS that will be a charge. Oh, you may need to, you know, find an integration into a data partner. That may be a charge. And so these things can take on a life of their own for maintenance and updates. And um I think that's that's definitely, you know, a piece that um you don't think about when you just get in cuz you are like, I just want to build this thing, but you don't understand, you know, essentially how some of these additional costs can add on. Uh one of the questions that I had was around blind spots. And so um when you are looking for excellences constantly looking for excellence in the founders that you're investing in um sometimes these sorts of people they're very you know they're self maybe not always self-aware but they're confident they're aggressive they're trying to become a founder and they don't necessarily have clarity around their blind spots in people that you've seen that are hyper successful hyper excellent in these areas. What are blind spots that you've maybe just seen from a distance that um high performers could be more aware of? Is there anything that comes to mind that that you know you've seen as almost a trend or something that people can take note of? Lack of humility. How so? So, you know, you're like in some cases um it's great to be bullheaded and to run that Mac truck through that culerack, right? And in some cases, you've got to take stock and you got to say, should I be going through that through through that wall, right? Um or or do I need to to go around the corner? Like is is this product that I that I'm building do people actually want it? Like what is the market telling me, right? Like are you willing to listen to that or are you um just going to plow forward, right? And you got to have a a a level of of humility, which doesn't mean that you always listen to the advice that you're that you're given or that the signals that you're seeing from the market in this point in time are always going to be the same or or even that they're correct, right? But you've got to be willing to truly take it on board, analyze it, and make a decision from there. And I the the companies that I've seen like really fail um and fail pretty quickly is because they're not able to do that, right? They're not able to or they're not willing to just listen, right? Again, you don't have to you don't have to comply, right? But you've got to listen, analyze, just take it on board. That's that's probably the biggest thing. Um the other thing is um a reluct a reluctance to um letting people go that aren't uh a good fit for the organization or are not producing in in the way that you need them to to produce, right? We're all human beings and and you know um I think most of us tend to be nice people, right? And so if someone's doing okay, you know, like they have a family that they're supporting off of this salary, etc., it's it's a hard decision to to let them go, right? But if if they're not it, if if they're not um a part of the equation that's going to take this company to the next thing, they have to go. You've got to make room for someone that can, right? Do you feel like the best leaders that you've seen can take that player on the field that's the wrong fit or not doing it right in in that way and then make them the best fit or get them to that place or do you think the best leaders realize it's not a fit out of the gate and they're just more about speed and making the decisions quickly? Does that make sense? The It I think it depends on the the stage of of the company. um at at certain points in the company, you don't have time for someone to learn how to do this function, right? They've got to just they got to do it, right? Even if they don't know how to do it, they got to learn how to do it quickly, right? So, I I think often times what you're what you're doing is you're hiring for both experience and potential in in in the early stages. And the potential is that yeah, you know, this person is um I don't know uh doing some engineering work right now. Um but we think they could actually lead engineering teams, right? And so we're on we're in the first 10 um employees of the company, right? And so yeah, this person's a a great coder, right? But I know that, you know, as as we have to hire folks, she can hire um you know, folks similarly talented as as she is. and and then she can actually um lead that team, manage these people, right? So you're looking for um you know the the the skill set that you need today but also that they can um easily um move into the skill set that you need them to to have tomorrow which is one of the hardest parts at least for me in growing you know coefficient labs and I've heard this with so many startups is that the team that gets you from 0 to a million dollars is different than the team that gets you from 1 to 10 and 10 to 100 and like there's evolutions of companies and certain people are better fits for different stages of a business. And it's, you know, it's certainly um, you know, part of that journey is seeing like which of the teammates, like you said, like to move up in stages, whereas those that like to kind of be in at those different levels. With AI being such a hot topic right now in 2025, is it a complete like automatic no if the teams now are not using AI in their product flow for you? Like if you meet a founder and they've got some solution but they don't have any AI as part of it are is your first response to them hey this looks great but like integrate AI and come back to me or are you still in a space where like there are companies that are still agnostic from AI and can still be very fundable companies for you? Um yeah AI is a tool right? Um, so what I'm first and foremost I'm I'm looking at the business, right? So what is this thing that you're building and that you're going to sell? Who needs it? Do I believe that, you know, there's a massive market for it? Right? So that that's number one. Now, do you um could you leverage AI to u maybe go a bit faster? If if that's the case, then why aren't you? And what does that say to me about you as a as as a founder, right? Um but no, it's it's not a um black and white. Yeah. And it's not a mustave in in c certain cases, right? Um you could be the the pioneer of of this space, right? And so right now, what you need to do is you need to um get a product out the door and uh get some customers using it and loving it, right? And then um you know once you've done that the next thing is figuring out how do I um how do I do this cheaper? Yeah. Faster. And maybe that's where AI comes in comes into play. Now if you're a founder and you're and you're like oh I'll never use AI or I don't see any value in it. Well that tells me that you're you're not necessarily uh you know the most intelligent um you know founder. Uhhuh. Now, I would imagine that before you invest in us in a startup, it's a little bit of like dating where like you're kind of getting to know each other, the vibe, you're learning about their problem, and then once you give them money, um it's almost like you're like moving in together a little bit and you kind of are able to get more under the weeds. And regardless of whether it's before you give them money or after you give them money, how are you able to assess if they're being efficient with your money? Like I can I'm I can understand the idea of someone like wiring me or someone here's a million dollars, here's $5 million, but how do you actually know, oh yeah, they are either using my money efficiently or I should invest in them because they're using money efficiently? Yeah, you kind you kind of uh try to weed this stuff out during the the cording process. Okay. Right. Um you know where just with questions that you ask. Yeah. You're just asking questions, getting getting to know them, getting to know how they think. Um you know, uh you're always going to ask, you know, use of funds and um and what their plan for that for that is. Um you want to see um you know, a budget at least for the next year, right? um which usually uh will tell you how they expect to deploy the capital that um that they're raising, right? And you can have very pointed questions about that use of capital, right? Like why why are you putting, you know, 20% in marketing and, you know, 40% in engineering and this and that, right? Just let them answer. Yeah. Right. And and um it's got to make sense, right? Um and then so now you're like, okay, well this they put some real thought into this, right? um the uh you know once you've done the investment and um you know now you're an investment partner, right? Um and that's the thing you look for too in um before before closing the the the round is how are the how are they viewing you, right? Are they just viewing you as a means to an end? Like, okay, I need this capital, so, you know, let me go get some capital. Or are they looking for a thought partner, right? So, not someone that's going to or a team that's going to tell them what to do, but um a a team that's capable of offering advice and and assistance. And do they want that? Right. And because for me, um we're or at MAC, you know, we're very active investors. we we get involved with our with our founders, right? And so we don't we're not just going to be call it dumb money or whatever, right? Or just um um uninterested investors, right? Because there are firms that that's what they do. We're just going to write this check and you go off and do what you do and we'll see you at the end of this thing. Like that's not us, right? And so so we're teasing that out as we're meeting as we're meeting founders, right? And going through this process. Now, it it um the deal closes and you know what what we usually do is we set up, you know, monthly um check-ins, right? Where they could just be halfhour meetings, right? Where we're just talking about, okay, what's going well? What's not going so well? Where do you need help? And also share, you know, um the company vital. So, is your burn rate which where you said it was going to be at? Are you are you um uh spending the capital in the places where you said you were? If not, then you know why the shift, right? So we just putting little data points on the map and just seeing how the lines are connecting themselves. Yeah. And just just having having a conversation with them and just making sure that they know that you know you are paying you are paying attention and you're paying attention um you know because you want what's best for them and what's best for the for the company. This also may be a very stupid question, but what should founders do right after they're done pitching you or after they've had a good meeting or something like you know the again think that they've just had their first VC meeting and they're like holy [ __ ] I think it went good. What's the next step for a founder in your opinion? Like what do you want to hear from? What do you want to see after a good meeting if anything at all? Whatever we talked about it being right. I think most most investors will tell you like what's next, right? Got it. Or um what information they you know um what additional information they require, right? And I would just say make sure your follow-ups are are um both quick and comprehensive, right? Um the the other thing is like you know we'll be having a conversation and um you know we could come we could come across a topic where you don't have the information available in the meeting right but you have the information somewhere in in in in the company or you know on some drive somewhere back or something. Are they are they are they taking notes? Are they sending that up to sending that back to make sure that you have the information that you need to help you make the decision as quickly as possible? Now, when it comes to you assessing like a startup that is in a really fastmoving industry like you know whether it's AI or the W like there's so there's so much verticalization happening now. Are there any you know things that you're looking for in a fast growing market? Is there any way that you can assess a founders's capabilities knowing that there's so much competition? Uh is it everything you just talked about already with like their excellences or how how can you look for that diamond in the rough when you know it's such a muddy water? Well, competitive landscape is definitely one of the um the things that you're going to evaluate, right? If it's, you know, super crowded space, right? Why why do I believe that this company is going to be able to you know crawl out of that mud right um in all likelihood they probably are not going to be right so unless they are doing something that's just fundamentally different or you know gives them some like extreme edge it's unlikely that we're going to um you know invest in in such a saturated uh market. Is there anything that they can do in those instances to proactively address those risks? Is it just the way they talk and they vibe with you? Or is there a level of preparation or research that could be done? Like in in those situations where you're like, I know I'm going to get them with these questions. Not that you're trying to get them, but you like you know it's crowded. You know you're going to give them and then they answer it just perfectly. Like what is it do you think that they did? Is it just their knowledge of the space? Is it their preparation that they knew you were going to kind of go in that direction? How can how can founders that are in a busy space almost get ahead of it? Yeah. I I think understanding the competitive landscape is the best thing that they can do and um being able to articulate, you know, very clearly um why they'll, you know, transcend that competition, right? or or why they'll be just competitive in, you know, in in that space. And it's got to be believable and there's got to be something novel about either the technology or the approach that that they're that they're um taking, right? Or they're providing something that is essential to these customers that no one else um can provide or can provide in the way that they can provide it. Now, transitioning a little bit into the venture side of things, like one of the things that you mentioned was that like sales is at the forefront of everything in a startup, but I don't think a lot of people realize that sales is really like at the forefront of being a venture capitalist as well because you have to sell LPs, you have to sell founders and why they should work with you. And so, just going back to like your early career, what were some of the strategies, if any, that you used to help build early relationships with LPS? like how did you get started when you know you're just like I don't know any people. So how did you kind of build a framework that enabled you to get your first one or two or five or 10 and how can other people take that kind of advice uh to heart for themselves? Yeah, I mean sales is really all about relationships. It's it's relationship building, right? like um human nature is to want to work with, want to spend time with people that you connect with and that you like. And so the the best thing that that I did um in the early days was go to people that I trusted that I knew my my targets also trusted and liked. And and once I got the the people that I trusted to believe in what I was doing, the next logical place is well, who should I talk to next? Who do you want who do you want to put me in front of to also share this? Right? And so now you're coming in warm and vetted, right? And so now I have the opportunity to um help them understand why the person that sent me here believes so strongly in our ability to win. Now for so you know Ethan who is off camera sitting here he's from Indiana and came to Los Angeles and so he doesn't necessarily have a network of people that he's grown with that have then become his mentors and his trusted ecosystem here. And so for someone that has no network, maybe they move from Africa to America or they whatever it might be, how can you how can one navigate the kind of ability to start to get mentors and start to get people like you're talking about without feeling like I'm just taking from them or I'm taking their time or like I'm just asking Marlin to make me intros and he doesn't even know who I am or there's no trust built. How can someone that doesn't have those people start to develop it in their 20s or their 30s so that 10 years down the road they have it? You know, do you have any suggestions for people that don't have a network and really they just they're just starting from ground ground zero? You just got to do it. The the world is getting smaller and smaller because of the internet and mobility and and technology generally speaking, right? So, you got to know someone that is, you know, attached to finance in in some way, and you've just got to weave and and get there. That's that's literally all you could do. I mean, sure, um uh my partner Mike is is great at the cold outreach, right? So, you know, he'll make he'll make a list of um you know, um institutional investors and um and craft, you know, emails and send it to them and you know, some small percentage of of of that massive list of folks that he will reach out to will respond. So, you know, I'm not saying that the only way to go is to get these soft introductions, but if um and if you can't get those soft introductions, well, you've got to go gorilla on it, right? You've got to you got to figure out how to how to get in front of these people without being a pest. Um you know um you've got to find ways to communicate um the value in in what you're um what you're building and what you're offering. Um and that's one thing you said last episode was like be a VC before you're a VC. like you know if you're able to start to either pass deal oh hey Marlin like I saw that you were interested in software companies and like I met this team and I don't know if so you know that's certainly a way and another thing that you mentioned that for me has been like by far the best uh next step is the make a list I think sometimes it's so overwhelming when you don't like I I don't know who I'm supposed to talk to whereas if you like go into your social media followers and you make a list of all of your followers or you go to your LinkedIn connections and you see who you're like, it's usually like starting to make a list is the thing that starts to drive attention to it. And I think that's like really good advice for people that think they don't have anyone, but they really maybe just aren't like they don't have visibility into it. Yeah. when it comes to your um decision- making framework, how do you evaluate deals um that you like decide to pass on? You know, even though they might be the right fit for you or like there's something about it, you end up passing it along. Is there, you know, anything that you've seen that, you know, ends up just not being a good fit for Mac or that, you know, you end up just uh passing along the the grapevine, if you will? Yeah, I mean we we can't really do those those generalities, right, or generalized things like that. Um it there's certain there's certain industries that are harder, right? So like I I've seen a lot of education technology um companies, right? It's hard to um to find a winner in that space and you know I have one in in my portfolio, Wonders School, and they continue to do do well. But um you know I've I've had I had one one other at at some point that one failed right. Um so just given given how difficult it is to to build that kind of a company um you know something has to be extraordinary about the opportunity for for me to move forward or um you know I see a lot of u music centric startups right and um you know my first uh co-founder in my in my first fund was from the music industry so I learned a lot from him in in terms of you know what um what what success would look like um you know what what are the um kind of the deficiencies in um in the music industry and what would need to be created in order to do it. But even even understanding that it's hard to build um a music technology company that scales and so you know so that would make it you know difficult right so we have the areas that we continue to invest in for reasons because we've found success there and we feel like we know what the formula is right and then there are areas where um you know we've we've tried and just don't feel as comfortable investing in in those in those areas. It's you know it's trial and error. You're looking at market dynamics a bunch of things. Have has your due diligence process evolved over time like you know right during co it seemed like it was like you know a free-for-all like so many companies were getting invested and then after co we started to move into this recession and now it's like we're starting to come back. Like have you evolved your due diligence or has it been even more a reason to like stay in your kind of zone and not let all of the craziness interfere with your decision-m? Has there been an evolution with, you know, how funds have been evolving, startups have been evolving, AI, all of that? Any any change that you've seen in how you decide on what companies you want to invest in? I think the biggest learning is like don't skip steps, right? Um, if a if a deal is moving really fast and the market is throwing a a bunch of stuff at money at a um at a company, don't skip the steps. Um, what's the underlying message behind it or why like what why you'll miss something? You you'll miss something and that thing that you miss may be very important to to the decision-m process, right? So you you might you got to find ways to do it faster in in kind of those accelerated um environments. Um but you but go through your process, right? Um so that that's I think that's one thing. The other thing is, you know, um do your own work, right? Like um you can't just trust the the diligence that another investor says that they've done, right? Um cuz who knows if they would have asked that one essential question that um that that you're going to ask, right? You don't know. So it's like you can leverage their work but um but but don't fully depend on on on their work. I think those are the things. And then um well co also um taught us that we don't have to meet everyone in person that that we invest in right there. Um, we found ways to, you know, vet personalities. Um, which is what you're, you know, when you're in person, that's what you're doing. You're saying like, \"Do I like this person?\" Right? Totally. Do I want to, you know, um, be around them for the next 7 to 10 years, right? Um, do I think that in in tough times, we can have, you know, difficult conversations and it be okay. um like there there are ways to to um sus those things out without you know going to dinner or um you know a few times or lunch or drinks or whatever you whatever you want to call it. Yeah, there there just other ways to um to to to do that. Um and um the other thing is just relying on offbalance sheet references too. You want to you want to make sure you know you're you're doing as many of those as possible. like who do who do I know that knows this person that they didn't write down as a reference? Um, you know, what can I what can I learn from them? Now, you've had the chance through Mac and just all of your businesses really, but specifically over this last, you know, uh, uh, several years, the chance to grow talent to oversee, you know, more junior investors and junior teammates. And what have you found for yourself to help you know help you help your team succeed? Like what's required of a you know managing partner or the founder or like the head of a VC fund? What do you think is required today to support their junior team to really like help the whole fund evolve? I think you put people in position to um to succeed. So, one of the best things that we could have ever done is hire our COO who who leads operations and now she has a um one and a half um you know people that report to um to her. So there you know there are things that um that she's put in place that has been able to free up you know our um our associates and principles so that they can um focus more so on deal sourcing and evaluating opportunities. um because they don't have to um to do some of the operational things that we needed them to do before um because the the um you know the the partners couldn't do all those all those things you know by ourselves. Um the other thing I I think is um just uh sharing the load. So, you know, each quarter, um, we deliver, um, you know, financial statements and we write a very extensive, um, letter to all of our investors, which which captures, you know, um, how, uh, the bulk of the portfolio is is performing. There's specifics about, you know, each each company, why we're excited about them, why we're worried about others, etc. And you know, instead of, you know, the three um founders and and and general partners um writing that, no, we're having the folks that um work side by side with us um on these deals take portions of of those updates and and we basically crowdsource um that that letter. And you know, what what they're learning in this process is how do I communicate to um to LPs? So as they graduate um you know their their levels and they get to a place where they're a partner and they have to spend time with LPS. This is something that they've been doing for a while. It's now kind of innate. Right. That was actually my my next question as we uh get to the to the end of this podcast. It's been uh really awesome. Marlin, I so appreciate you, man. What are some of the most common mistakes that new fund managers make in managing their LP relationships? like what are some blind spots that you've learned along the way now that maybe you wouldn't make that same mistake if you were a new fund manager now? Not spending time with them um with the LPs. Yeah. Um you know like you spent time with them during the courting process, right? Like you've got to figure out a way to to to keep doing that. Like just you know um uh just sending them information and you know catching up with them when they ask is not good enough. like you've got to, you know, we've got investors in the Midwest. We got to fly out there and, you know, and and go to dinner with them and, you know, and see them and uh continue to deepen that those relationships. So, I think that's that's the biggest thing. Don't don't show up when it's time to um to raise uh your next your next fund, right? Uh keep them in the loop. And then I think um they have a wealth of just knowledge and information, right? Because they're not only seeing what's going on with our fund, they're seeing what's going on with all of the other funds that they're that they're invested in. So like, you know, leverage them as as partners, just like we want our founders to think of us as investment partners, like we should think of our LPs as investment partners, right? what um here's a challenge that that we're having you know the founders are de are you know the GPS are debating you know this this thing what have you seen in you know um uh in in other firms you know um what would be your recommendation recommendation or what are the things that you would avoid here right um so just leveraging them in in that way I I think is also um something I think a lot of um you know uh newer GPS uh don't embrace enough Marlin this was honestly a really really cool episode. I loved like going a lot deeper into some of these questions. Um I'll finish this podcast just like I finished the last one. What are you most excited about right now? You know, what's got your attention? Um yeah, it could be personal, could be business, could be, you know, anything in between. Um 2025, January, end of the month here. Uh we're feels like things are moving quick already, but what what's got you most excited for this year? Um man, I you know in terms of the the work stuff like I am really excited to see um what people build um in the intersection of uh fintech AI and the intersection of fintech and healthcare. I think I think there's some amazing opportunities um that are just starting to um to to bud. So really excited about that. Personally, you know, being here in LA coming out of January, I am excited that um the fires are under control and, you know, that resources are being deployed to the many who have been um significantly impacted by that tragedy. Marlin, thank you again for making the trip across town to visit us. We really appreciate you. Can't wait for your next uh Culture House events and everything MAC has going on. We love you guys. Just want to say thanks again. And to everyone watching at home, I'm Sean Goldfan from Coefficient Labs and this is demo day. Peace, guys. [Music]",

accelerator incubator or VC programs from around the world hello everybody and welcome to demo day I am your host but I am NOT Sean gold fan I am Steven ROTC one of the producers behind demo day and today we're trimming the camera around on ourselves I'll be interviewing Sean the founder and CEO of coefficient labs and the regular host of this program sean is a Southern California native who launched his entrepreneurial career in third grade he went on to win the University of Miami's business competition and now runs coefficient labs a top user acquisition team in Los Angeles on the proud squad behind demo day please enjoy this special two-part episode on our founder Sean this will be the season 1 finale if you haven't yet please subscribe on Apple podcasts and leave a review season 2 is soon to follow without further ado let's get into demo day [Music] Matt calls me into his office and I go to sit down at the office Matt is sitting right across from me I see Todd who is the CEO I was sitting right to my right and Matt looks at me and he says Sean you are such an amazing team member we we love having you here you work so hard you have so much passion and energy but unfortunately you know we've been talking to the board and we need to bring on a director of growth or director of user acquisition that has more experience than you do I'm very very sorry but today is unfortunately your last day working here at instant canvas and I looked at him and I said haha Matt very funny dude what do you really want to talk to me about and he looks at me he says no I'm serious this is your last day and I turn over and I look at Todd and I go Todd you're kidding right and Todd is like I'm really sorry and I look back at Matt I go Matt you can't do this to me like I love this so much how could you take this away I'm not even making any money like I don't understand what did I do wrong you didn't do anything wrong it's not you it's me you know giving me that that that word in without you know begging I was like please don't it I'm really sorry and right there I walked out of the room I grabbed my stuff I walked across the street where my car was parked and got in the car and just broke down just sobbed I was so sad I took my phone out and I wrote in my little journal which I still look at often this is the saddest day of my entire life breast cancer with my mom my dad with his bypass surgery my grandparents like all that stuff that happened this was so much harder for me to deal with because I wanted to be a part of this team so bad that I couldn't believe it would be taken away and you know at the time like I said before I really looked up to Matt as if he was Steve Jobs but Matt himself looked up to Steve Jobs a lot like we would do we would always go on walks Matt would always be taking us on these walks and I remember one time asking another team member like why does Matt always go on walks oh well Steve Jobs goes on walks all the time so there was something in my head that was like you know what does Steve Jobs have to do with this situation and serendipitously there was a book that had come out by Walter Isaacson which was the Steve Jobs biography it was it was you know one of the most well written books on Steve Jobs but I hadn't read it yet and so I thought to myself if I read this book I will be able to figure out why Matt fired me like what how did this even happen and so I go to Barnes and Nobles I buy this big huge biography book and I am voraciously reading through it I'm talking seven eight hours non-stop going through it and for anyone that's read that book there's a part of the book where Walter Isaacson talks about how the horror maybe it was Steve the hardest job of a CEO is to differentiate between a players and B players that when you hire B players onto your team no a player wants to work with a B player and B players beget C players and C players we get D players and I read this and I will never forget I remember sitting there reading this book kind of pull my head up and I go this [ __ ] thinks that I am a B player huh unbelievable I am gonna show him that I don't need years of experience I don't need anything to be this sort of person and I was on a quest I had to be the user acquisition guy I had to be the growth hacker this I couldn't let someone take this away just because I didn't have years of experience and it was almost immediate I had the the fortunate opportunity to find out about this thing called General Assembly and now General Assembly has been around for years and years but at the time General Assembly had just opened in LA it was there an all-girl class they had never done this before and they had one class that was the user acquisition marketing course it was a ten week course thirty-five hundred bucks or something to get into this course and it was taught by David O who is the head of marketing or head of growth at beach men and this guy named Joe Shea who had sold a company already on the backs of AdWords and search and and so to veterans in the space and I go to general assembly this guy named Charlie is the one that was sort of organizing the first the first class there and I said Charlie I just got laid off from my job I was not even I was making no money to begin with I don't have $3,000 I don't have four grand to spend on this course I have to get in this I will intern for General Assembly I'll work events for you I'll come in after hours and I'll do whatever you need me to do I have to be in this class and he said cool let me see what I can do I helped him out a little bit on you know some events and he got me into this class and it was in this class that completely changed my life because they don't really teach you in advertising school or in marketing even the concept of the funnel it's crazy but you know to a lot of people listening to this of course you've heard of the funnel but for some this idea of like advertising marketing and something called the funnel like that doesn't make any sense but David and Joe would talk about you know it starts with the impressions and then it goes to the clicks and then it goes to the add two carts and then it goes to the purchase and it's our job as marketers to identify each step of the funnel and try to think about how we can make it better and you know it's really cool I always joke around with people that if you were to throw a documentary crew to go back to back to the time of that General Assembly class some of the most amazing entrepreneurs out of LA really came from that class you have Charlie Wang you started Josephine you have David oh who's that fabfitfun you have Wanda llanto who ran washio you have you know members like you know that went that worked at a company called branch and lettuce and so many amazing people came out of this particular class and I think a lot of it has to do with you know the timing the professors that were teaching at David Oh Joe shout out like you guys changed the lives of so many of us and you know it was going through that program teaching and learning from some of the best that really reinvigorated the fact that I want to do this I want to be the guy that's leading the growth and I had an opportunity to get recruited into a company called creative circle and that became the next chapter of my life was you know moving from a small six seven person startup at instant canvas to then leading the digital marketing team at creative circle creative circle hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue hundreds of employees this is a big big business but my job was to really help lead their digital marketing side which had a lot to do with managing managing agencies you know my job was find the right agency for the company hire the right agency work with the right agency and I was the middleman between my CMO and the agencies that we worked with and I let's get him into now into coefficient labs but in terms of creative circle what was it about your time there that led you to start your own agency I think that you know there's a couple things one back to our boy Gary Vaynerchuk he says that what differentiates a entrepreneur from an entrepreneurial tendency is you quite literally feel almost like you're suffocating that you can't imagine a life where you're not the one running the running the show and it's true for me at least like going from Playfair where I was doing everything on my own to now reporting to a CMO and you know I would come up with these ideas and sometimes he would be down with them and sometimes he would in um you know I saw all these opportunities one of the biggest things was a company called hired comm was just coming out and I was you know wanting us to move more into a SAS I wanted us to use technology better and I think that you know at a high level I just wanted to be the number one again I wanted to be you know in charge and so I think that that got things brewing but but really the I would say moment that I felt like I needed to make the change was in understanding I took a full year of working there to understand how agencies worked like when you I was an advertising major at the University of Miami and in my head I thought like I'm gonna join an advertising agency Crispin Porter 72 in sunny you know some media buying agency I knew I wanted to do something like that but I didn't know how it worked like I didn't know actually what they did so when I was working at creative circle I finally had the opportunity to see what exactly is going down here like how do they run their show and men I just found that there are a couple of things across the board across the advertising agencies that were so misaligned from the business goals of the company the first one being around the the the long term contract so almost every agency you talk to is a minimum of one year or two year minimum contract so when we're interviewing these agencies and I'm thinking like man we really have to get married to these guys is this the right fit for us the second thing is they never or rarely would do the creative in-house so if you worked for a media buying agency they would launch any ad you wanted but you had to supply the ad creative and coming from inste canvas where I was coming up with all the creative myself and the date and everything was happening in real time it was such a pain in the ass you know I would send an email to the media buying team and say hey guys Facebook just launched a new feature we should try doing this sort of add the media buying team would say that sounds great Sean send over the creative you'd like us to run I would then say ok let me go and hire freelance designers to make the creatives you'd hire the designer the designer would say they'd get it to you on Friday Friday comes along they're like hey I'm sorry I'm sick this week let me get it to you neck and it's this constant just you know just a pain in the ass to to match the creative with the media buying team and the third element of these agencies which just drew me drove me crazy was how they charged so I didn't know how they charged companies right I thought it would be like yeah you charge for your services but the way they do it is a percentage of ad spend so they basically make you spend X amount of dollars a minimum minimum ad spend and then they take a percentage of it so for us we would be like you know I don't know December January February like our biggest months for creative circle we're spending a ton of money all of these agencies are giving us 110 percent they're right there with us working you know doing the best they can but then we'd get into like you know March April May start of moving into the slower months so we would reduce our ad spend and when we reduced our ads and we stopped spending as much money what happened our agencies were nowhere to be found so the incentives for these agencies are oh let's get the Klein to spend more money not let's try to get their goals met and I found that like men long-term contracts you know not doing the creative in-house or separating the creative in the media and having this percentage of ad spend that might work for coca-cola or GM or some of these bigger brands it would never ever work for an instant canvas or any of these other startups that I was meeting and it was at that moment I thought wow there's no ad agency that was built specifically for the start-up in mind that works in a way very similar to a scrum or an agile development team like this was a big deal at the time you know at the lean startup had just come out for any of you that have read the Lean Startup they talk to you about hype ha thesis testing and experimenting and constantly iterating and pivoting but no one is doing that on paid acquisition no one is doing in on ads and the reason they're not doing it is because everything is so fragmented you have media buying teams here you have creative teams here they don't play nice with each other and so that was the moment that I thought I want to build an advertising agency that specifically built for startups to handle scaling paid acquisition so you had the idea formed you knew what you wanted to fix in the advertising and marketing model but you you were at this job so I imagine why you pick up the phone you're calling your friends your family saying hey I have got this idea it's not sunglasses it's not fedoras I've I've got it what was the response like when you started telling people close to you that you were thinking about getting out of your day job and starting something completely new yeah I I think you know it was interesting because there was really only two entities that I really cared about at the time I care about their opinion right really just two the first were my parents and the second was my boss my boss at creative circle Adam Bly Troy was a complete game changer for me because he taught me so much about empathy about about giving your your team members the opportunity to fail in a safe environment where he would encourage testing he mastered the white board I mean if you look around the office at coefficient labs you'll see there's whiteboards everywhere and that was because Adam was so good at taking someone like me very ATD very you know mind is scattered all over the place but he would bring these visuals and he would visualize these things and by me looking at the visual on the whiteboard it would really help me with the strategy so you know I was so worried that Adam wouldn't support me in this next chapter you know of my life that I was stressed out about it for a while but I did you know finally get the courage to go in there and talk to him and before I even talked to my parents this I talked to Adam you know he's a very fatherly figure and I told him what I wanted to do and surprisingly I was expecting Adam to just be totally on board with it like I was expect because of how great was but I definitely rocked him a little bit you know when I went in there and told him that I was thinking about in the next month two months three months starting my next chapter I could tell you know maybe not because he didn't want me to go but it's like man we've really built this tag team together you know he was he was the senior maverick I was his young gun that was going in and together we you know ran an entire marketing department but I think that through talking it through with Adam and helping him understand that like I got it you know Adam you've been an entrepreneur you know what it's like like I'm young I got a go for it that when he gave me his blessing that was the moment that I felt okay I got this you know I can do this now at that time I had moved out of my apartment with my friend Kevin that started at instant campus and I then got a new new place a new apartment in Santa Monica a little closer to the beach and I lived with this girl her name is Jen a family friend that we shared her brother-in-law I'm sorry her sister-in-law was a family friend of mine for 20 you know 25 years and so I was living with Jen at the time working at creative circle beginning to think about how I would make a transition into my own business and so I get Adam my boss's approval then it was time to move over to mom and dad and I it's funny because I thought Adam my boss would be like go for it and I thought you know my parents would in some way be like go for it but I was not expecting really the resistance that my parents gave me because I think you know as as a parent and I'm certainly learning this with my puppy now and you know and getting getting older all you want is what's best for for your family and I think you know my dad being a CFO very conservative conservative guy knows how risky it is to start a business knows the ups and the downs the loneliness the you know all of the trials and tribulations that I think in his mind he was trying to protect me from going down that path and for about the first year or so of coefficient labs I really didn't get that you know it's like my parents are the most supportive the most you know like do whatever you want that makes you happy but I definitely remember them thinking like this is not the right play for you you don't have experience running an advertising agency you don't have you know a partner that you're able to grow and scale with you're just you know you're just you and I really really was close on many occasions to say man like did I make a big mistake here and it was Jen it was my roommate you know day in day out going home after like a long day at work at creative circle I would then go to the coffee shop and work the late hours and then I'd come home and I would tell Jen you know uh had the shitty conversation my parents like they keep giving me [ __ ] about leaving my job and generally just looked me in the eye I was like you know what you can do this okay you don't need your mom and your dad you don't need anyone to tell you you can do this I know how talented you are I know that you're able to do it and it was incredible at how important it is to give your friends that encouragement as opposed to being that person that's saying this is never gonna work one of my favorite books of all time is called The Four Agreements so if there's one thing I hope people get from this Pacus I do hope you pick up the book The Four Agreements and one of the things they talk about is the power of the word right the word using words is the manifestation of your thoughts and your words have the ability to both break someone down or completely build them up just on how you use the words so when you go and tell someone hey that's not gonna work or you're not good enough or you should just do X Y & Z that can literally stop you in your tracks and so many people never get started because people have used the word to prevent them from growing whereas the flipside someone like Jen can say you can do this I believe in you the way she used the words manifested this momentum and it's something I think about you know when you are in that moment and your friend comes to you for advice like you're saying you know when if you have the luxury the honor of having your friends reach out to you to ask for your advice be the person that builds them up not the one that tears them down so so you get that encouragement and then you say okay I'm doing it I've started doing this company what were the first let's say year to like you know before you had an office when it was really you at an apartment at coffee shops by yourself at co-working spaces what were those first couple years like I needed an opportunity I needed one client that was the thing I needed one I knew if I could get one I could get two I could get three I could get four and so I needed someone to take a chance on me and that person was Matt Murphy so even though inste campus brought you know at the time this pain this struggle this you know sadness right now today I look back and I [ __ ] love Matt Matt Monson I love Todd I love my story of instant campus because you cannot get the successes without going through the slog and so you know at the time one of the things that I love the most about insta campus was that I'll let this go one of the things that I love the most about instant canvas was that Matt Monson the CEO made it mandatory for all members of the team to get a mentor and he actually helped them set he helped us set up this mentor program and so I had the opportunity to meet Matt Murphy years before when I was at insta campus and he followed me along on my career you know was staying we would have a monthly call we would talk when I went to creative circle I told him about what I wanted to do and Matt was a venture capitalist and he said well hey I've got a couple of portfolio companies that could use a little help why don't we test this out on one of them and see how it goes oh my god Matt thank you thank you for this opportunity and so it all started with one client and the client was called quad it was an app that you know people will download and I worked out of my apartment I sat at the you know my my lunch table my kitchen table I made ads I did all the creatives myself I did the targeting myself I did the analysis and the reporting myself but it was very much a bootstrapped starting from nothing in my apartment and you know one client then turned into two once we got our second client I had enough money to bring on one member that could help me with the targeting and with the reporting and things like that once we got our third client I was able to bring on you know a couple of interns and so the very first couple of years you know mess messes sitting in the other room and he's been here since the very very beginning it was light and fun and an apartment and if you were to put a camera and let it time-lapse through you would see that we would be moving from the couch to the table to the bar to the couch to the table to the bar we would have meetings outside on the kitchen you know on like our outdoor patio we would walk down to the beach but it was very light and very fun however once we hit a certain point we had four or five clients I had the chance to move into this new thing called we work and we work was the coolest thing I'd ever seen it was made me think of like our old accelerator days at mucker except it was this awesome space and moving into my first space was the day that coefficient labs changed and became an actual business it wasn't just me trying to pull it all together it wasn't just a hobby it was a moment that was transformative and it also I think really changed the opinions of my parents and and they knew this was for real they knew that I was gonna make this happen so as the the team has grown and you mentioned Jen's encouragement early on she's gone from roommate to co-worker employee wife now head of ops here what was that journey like the simultaneously growing your business from scratch and then starting this relationship that would be so important to you personally but also so essential to the success of your business yeah I mean Jen is the yin to my yang you know she's she's my my ride-or-die my my my co-pilot here and I think it's important to know it didn't always it wasn't like that Jen just didn't you know wake up one day and say oh I want to be the you know the head of operations or I want to help you know Sean run this business it wasn't it wasn't like that at all Jen at the time was a concierge at a company called the Shore hotel she had incredible incredible people skills very organized very operationally savvy and had a lot going on at any given time but her background when she went to school was for art design creative she went to I believe fit um and so she was a very creative artistic person but she had been working in this really nice hotel doing you know lots of things around operations and whatnot and then Jen found out about two three months into us dating that she had the bracket gene the BRCA gene which is a genetic mutation that gilina Jolie had and many women across the country have it's a horrible horrible mutation and basically it increases your chances especially as a female of getting breast or ovarian cancer and my mom as I had mentioned before had breast cancer so it's a very you know important subject for me and Jen had to face an incredibly difficult decision which was she could either you know let the statistics play themselves out you know either she would be healthy or she wouldn't or she could do a preventative double mastectomy and Jen opted to do this preventative double mastectomy she had surgery and it was awesome to see how she processed this hurdle or this obstacle because so many people in this situation would say you know oh my gosh woe is me I can't believe this is happening I'm so you know I'm so sad this is so unfair Jen never said that once it was always I'm so lucky that I have the opportunity to be proactive about this I'm so fortunate that there are all of these other women that wake up and have cancer and I'm able to be proactive it was so refreshing to hear this perspective on it that when she was on leave this Medical Leave she kind of came to me and said you know hey like I do like being a concierge I've been doing it now for years and years but I don't think I always want to do this I love when you know when you and I talk about ads and creative and I can help you with the different ads like I like doing that and I said well why don't you go and take some classes in Adobe suite right like there's Santa Monica City College there's udemy courses online and you've got like eight months of paid leave from this hotel that you can do anything you want right and so right then Jen decided like maybe I want to be a designer maybe I want to lean more into this creative you know this world that she hadn't really tapped into in years and so she applied to several classes at Santa Monica City she started taking hours and hours and hours of udemy core is and she quite literally taught herself how to use Photoshop how to use InDesign how to start to do layout and web design and um it was during those months that you know she started to vocalize the fact that maybe she wanted to try something else other than the hotel and I was thinking like man I really need some help on these designs like I you know we now have more clients every week I'm still the one doing everything and I think that and he would be great if maybe you interned right and so Jen started interning at coefficient labs two three days a week she would work the other days at the hotel then like we got another client another client we're starting it bigger and she's been now working with me for maybe six months seven months and you know we kind of looked at each other and said hey like this is going really great what if you worked full-time as a designer here let's do it so she quit her job at the hotel she joined co-efficient labs full-time as a graphic designer worked as a graphic designer alongside me for about a year and by the time you know that first year went by I think we had had had at least six or seven new creatives underneath Jen and so we promoted Jen from graphic designer to the creative lead of the team she was managing all of the creatives of course me and her you know collaborating team working through it but Jen really rose through the rings from intern to graphic designer to the creative lead of the team you know now as we continue to expand and get bigger and bigger I think like back to what we were talking about before around putting your players into a position to succeed I think that's one of the things that you know entrepreneurs and CEOs have to be more aware of is what you need to get from you know from right here to across the street is different than what you need to get from here to Europe right like there's different skill sets that you need at different parts of the journey and right now the team is growing we have multiple pods you know Jen who is a phenomenal creative she loves operations she loves keeping the train running on time making sure all the team members are getting what they need to succeed this is getting what we need to succeed and so we mutually work together on transitioning her from a creative role into an OPS role where you know meandher still able to work every single day together and and keep pushing the business forward so for other entrepreneurs out there who are building their business and find themselves working alongside the the person they love and want to spend the rest of their life with you synthesize for us what the most important thing to keep in mind is when you're working alongside your your life partner every day yeah I think I think I have a couple thoughts on that so the first one is around is around team and I think that you know Jen and I look at our relationship both at home personally as well as in this business as like we're a team we're a we're a doubles team right we're a doubles team trying to take on the world and when you're on a team with one other person you're two partners you have to go into it knowing that I've got strains and you've got strains I've got weaknesses and you've got weaknesses and we need to work together to offset the other person's weaknesses whether it's through fate or we've had to work out or whatever that's where Jen and I fit in the best is like my strengths are her weaknesses and her weaknesses are my strengths and we start from a position of we are a team and teams are gonna go through ups and downs together but in the down times like when you're driving on the bus to the soccer game and you lose that big tournament you get back on the [ __ ] bus together and you go back to practice and I think that knowing that you're a team thinking about this concept of strengths and weaknesses I one of my favorite exercises to do I recommend this exercise to every CEO regardless if you're working with your significant other or just your employees I had Jen write down every single task that she did is the creative lead every them little big everything there's a list of maybe 30 or 40 different bullet points oh I you know come up with new ads I design this in that I have to manage my team I've got a you know managed to HR I'm doing here's all the things that I'm doing and I had her go in there and highlight in green the bullet points that really brought her alive that made her feel like she was adding a ton of value that made her feel charged up okay like I think about this concept of charge like some things when you do them and you know you're great at them actually charge you up like when you're a forward in soccer and you score a goal charges you up and like it plays into your strengths or when they take you and they make you play on defense and then this score on you you feel like a [ __ ] loser right like so I had Jen mark every single bullet that made her feel charged up and I had her write down every single bullet and mark every bullet in red that made her feel like she was taking away energy things that were making her feel worse about herself or that she wasn't prepared for things like that and when you have this clear you know visual of these are things that charge you up these are things that make you feel like [ __ ] let's do it easy let's put more emphasis into the charge and let's find ways to reposition Reed Ella gate the weaknesses and so I think you know that would be number two is focus on the charge and then number three and this is again you know something that I think is crucial especially if you're working with a significant other your it could be your best friend it could be your your husband your wife your brother your sister any of that when you have an argument when things don't go away you [ __ ] end it with an i-love-you you know you end it with a hug you end it not on the negative side because you're in this together and you know working with my best friend my best friend I've got a lot of people in my business in my life that we've grown together but it comes with this open conversation around hey we're all rowing in the same direction we're all trying to do our absolute best here and there's gonna be times you know and I've certainly have had to pull you outside and say hey we need to redirect we need a course correct you're but it ends with a hug it ends with and I love you and I think that is you know I hope I can say this forever that like you know I I can understand I have so many friends that go I could never work with my significant other why not you know why because you don't want to put the time to really think about their weaknesses and your strengths like or your weaknesses and I think it it comes down to that ego and and I really think like what makes Jenn's so special especially here at this company she has no ego you know so many people would feel like my identity is being taken away from me because I'm not the creatively now I'm doing ops if you - if you you know changed my title I would literally feel like my identity is leaving so I you know commend Jen so much for removing her ego and only focusing on how can we drive the business forward so while we're talking about about family and sort of sort of the the history of your family the different illnesses and Jen I wanted to talk about your brother Josh a little bit who I very sadly never got the chance to meet but you did share a short story collection of his with me while we were in college that I absolutely loved loved reading through but I know that Josh was your sort of always an inspiration for you and continues to be so so could you just talk a little bit about that relationship with your with your brother absolutely um so my dad and and and mom but you know my dad from his first marriage has four sons Brian Josh myself and my little brother Adam and he has what I call the greatest statistic of all time which is he had a son in the 60s the 70s the 80s and the 90s so the ages spread between myself and my little brother Adam my older brother Josh and Brian like we've always been very spread but we've had a tight-knit relationship forever like you know I have fond memories of every Christmas spending you know Christmas together and opening presents and you know playing sports and going to graduations and all of these amazing you know experiences and I believe I can't remember exactly when it was the first time I found out Josh was sick but I believe it was sophomore year at Miami I was just moving with you and Josh had gone in to the doctor and found out that he had a mole on his on his neck or shoulder that was malignant and was actually a cancerous it was a melanoma and a fairly aggressive melanoma they found it at stage four so it was it was already a very bad situation but I don't think I realized how bad it was I was just gone into college I was starting up fedoras Stora I didn't realize that like how important skin cancer you know I only like see my mom have breast cancer and she was fine and got through it everything so I think that I didn't realize at the time how serious it was and Josh didn't make it much easier because he always had a smile on his face always was positive I remember every time we would call each other if the other person didn't pick up we would leave a message that would go what like the the Budweiser commercial and I I vividly remember these messages just and it would even be like like we would let that just go on for like as long as our breath could go and it would just crack me up and so Josh and I were incredibly incredibly close although we didn't get to spend too much time together Josh was a professor at NYU he taught creative writing and taught students how to write short stories he was a published author he had a book and he just had a he had a like a persona around sweetness he was a sweet person he was never difficult he wasn't opinionated he was just a sweet guy and you know even though I knew he was sick it was never apparent to me that he was like really sick and you know there would be times when I was at Miami like a junior senior super senior year my mom or dad would say oh you know Josh isn't doing so good like he's you know he's really not doing so good and I would be thinking myself like oh you can't be doing that bad all right and he kept getting into these different trials these cancer trials where they would come out with a new medicine or a new way of helping and he always got accepted into them and then it would get better and I just kept thinking like God you know do to do to do like everything is great and it wasn't until I got back to California I in you know 2014-2015 that I really like realize like how sick he was like they had to take like part of his neck out they like they took out the cancerous part here and they had to like use cells from like his leg the cancer spread to his knee they had to do a knee replacement it went to his hip it went it was just like ever and I every time I would hear about this I'd be like wait why it's like really like this is happening to him but he would kept getting into these experimental treatments and I just always thought that like he would come out of this thing somehow someway and what was really sad about you know Josh is that he was constantly fighting against the clock of technology like you know there have been so many monumental shifts in technology every year like all of the experimental drugs that were coming out I just believed that he was going to beat it you know there's all the stem-cell therapy and treatments coming out and he would always always get accepted because of the fact that he was so sick again even though I didn't know really how sick he was and I you know I think it was maybe around I want to say like early 2015 we all went to Vegas from I believe was my little brothers 21st birthday it was Adams birthday me and Brian and Josh and Adam my dad my mom we all go to Vegas and Josh was like he was so sick the night we were at dinner that he couldn't really go out with us that night you know he was really sick and it was like man it was really the first time I had seen him because he's in New York and I don't get to spend that much time that I really realize like wow he's really not doing so well and maybe a couple weeks after that he knew that he was going to go to this treatment center in Houston Texas it was this new experimental stem cell-like treatment and it had four comparative to all of the other treatments no question had the best opportunity of helping Josh it was like they had a significant percentage of patients completely go into remission after yeah the cancer goes away for time after going through this treatment and all of us my mom my dad myself my brothers everyone was so excited that he was going to get into this treatment he got qualified for it he you know it was just a matter of time for them to bring him to Houston to do this and in about the month and a half two months leading up to this this treatment Josh started to decline and decline and decline and get sicker and sicker and sicker until the the people at the treatment center basically said you've lost too much weight for you to come to this treatment like it's gonna kill you you can't go through this is not a this is not a nice treatment this is like we're gonna bring you to the brink of death and then we're gonna build your immune system back up Josh had lost too much weight was too sick to everything and I I remember thinking at that moment like no [ __ ] way I'm gonna make this better I don't know how I'm gonna make it better but I'm gonna do it and I booked a flight from California to New York I flew out to New York by myself you know no parents no bruh I was going out there just to give my energy my love like whatever I could do [ __ ] get Josh to eat thing and I sat with him in the hospital you know each day I would go in there and I could just tell like he was not getting better and he was not able to keep his food down and you know I flew back home and oh it was just so it was so heart-wrenching but I I still remember like the quality of time we got to spend together just shooting the [ __ ] talking about girls you know talking about what was going on with me Josh hated talking about like how he was feeling or anything like that and I got home and you know it was almost like still even after going home I felt like he's gonna get there he's gonna make it to Houston there's just I know he's gonna be able to do it and you know a week went by two weeks went by and Josh called the family and basically said I don't want to want to do it anymore you know I'm done I I've been fighting this for so many years now I've been sick for so long I'm so much pain in my knee and my neck and all of these things like I just don't [ __ ] want to do it anymore and it was incredibly hard for me to hear that as someone that just believes that you can will you're way past these things uh and there is a finality to it it wasn't anyone trying to push him towards doing anything it was Josh's decision and from that moment on we started thinking about how could we make this the best situation under the circumstances and knowing that Josh did not want to go to Houston did not want to this was done he was [ __ ] done and he you know Hospice was the next play and his options were to go to hospice in New York City or we could have an alternative and the alternative for us was to bring Josh back to my home our home in Manhattan Beach where I grew up where my little brother grew up where I've spent all the years of my life and we turned our home house into a hoss just for Josh and you know we flew out or his best friends flew out from New York New Jersey and all across the globe in an hour our house was like a hotel for about ten days you know just filled with like love and happiness and togetherness we played video games we brought you know the doctors Josh got him everything he needed and in the most heartbreaking anger-filled wanting him to make it all of it it was so beautiful to say goodbye to my bro and and do it in a way that was respectful to him and his wishes that gave our family the opportunity to come together and Josh's passing is a constant reminder to me of you know life can turn so quickly and when my friends say like man Sean you have so much energy you have so much passion like you go out you you know let's go Monday let's go Tuesday I think it comes from like you know Josh didn't get that opportunity of being like [ __ ] yeah like let's go for it so I I live that way I try to make the most that I can because not everyone gets that shot and that's where my positivity comes from in that you know not every day is guaranteed and you always have to give your best thank you very much for for sharing that with us and and with everybody you know knowing your family as as well as I do I know how close you all are and you know having been been at your wedding and everything how much you all look out for each other and stick up for each other constantly if there's one part of Josh's personality either that you have or you wish had what would it be so you know there's a there's a guy a busy I don't know what you'd call a business guy a business personality bob a the bearded man he doesn't even know who I am but I'm gonna make a shout-out to him doesn't sound real he doesn't sound real right but you know you know what's up Bob a he you know I've been following him he posts on social and he recently got this tattoo on his arm and it says keep going and when I think about Joshua really whenever I when I saw him post then I saw that tattoo I thought like man that really personifies Josh to me that this concept of like even when you're so sick like even when everything is stacked against you you have to keep going and I think that's the thing that I take the most away from my big brother is that he just kept going until there was nothing in the tank and like for him to be able to go out knowing that he put it all out on the fields is something that I admire so much let's uh shift back now in the sort of last little bit of our conversation here about coefficient labs and what you've got going on right now so I need big changes in the last six months or things you're really excited for looking at the next little bit and the end of q4 well I mean I think the the biggest changes to coefficient labs has been moving away from like everything being on my shoulders right where I was always the guy that would report to the CMO or I was the guy that would have all of the ideas I was always this individual contributor like they call it whereas now I've had to transition more into that goal keeper mentality that I'm part of a team now we have to delegate we have to bring the mission right we have to set the right alignment in the right tone so I think the the biggest change to coefficient labs from when we started the business when it was just me and a couple you know people grind get out to where we are now is really how we form our team how we operate how do we help startups scale right the problem that coefficient lab solves is there are all of these startups seeking their next round of funding seeking survival trying to get users and customers like everything around their survival is predicated on can we grow can we get new members and new people to try us out so for coefficient labs to be a a tool a provider a partner that helps them get there makes me feel like we're helping these startups write you know reach their goals we're helping you startup survive so there's a great amount of good vibe and honor around helping them get to this this milestone but how do we do it right like like if that's our why then how and and that's really in this formation that we call the pod or a growth pod and so if you've ever worked with an ad agency or a media buying agency you typically work with like a media manager a coordinator or an Account Representative or account man or whatever you want to call it but you don't ever really talk to the creative team or you don't really get to talk to the media buying team you're working with this person that's sort of you're kind of like your project manager where is at coefficient labs what we realized is that if you want to scale on Facebook and Instagram if you really want to grow you have to constantly be testing new creatives new targeting new you know new experiments but you you have to constantly be moving and the only way that you can do that successfully is if you have the right people constantly working on these different assets right on these different areas and so what we do at coefficient labs is we've created a formation that we call the pod and every startup that we work with gets a pod our growth pod to work with which is made up of a growth lead that runs all of the day-to-day marketing they're the ones changing the experiments working in the ad account managing the media buys a creative lead that runs all of the weekly creatives submits new ads changes the colors the different layouts and styles and then a data science lead so these three leads work together on weekly advertising sprints and moving away from this world where I had to do all three of these areas - now where coefficient Labs is a much more well-oiled team we really have figured out that what makes us different what makes us special is the fact that we've really nailed the pod structure in helping startups scale so if the previous 12 months involved the formation of the pod and sort of a rethinking of how you were going to offer services to startups what is the next 12 months having a store that you now that you kind of have a firmer idea of how exactly this machine runs yeah I I think that you know while putting the right people in the right seats is probably the biggest job of a CEO and something that I've been working on constantly getting better and better at I think that you know some of the areas that we've been focused on this year and into next year as well has been great now that we have the foundation right if you think about like a big building it always starts with the foundation and I feel like you know over the last several years we've really been you know just tightening that foundation and just applying layer by layer and now that our foundation is there it's really about growing right around scaling just like we do for our clients it's now the same thing for coefficient labs and so you know it always starts when you when it comes to scaling around thinking about who your customer is like who is your customer and while our customer is you know startups the ceos of startups what we realized is that we're actually a much better fit for venture capitalist or much better fit to partner with these VC funds to offer help or services to their portfolio when needed as opposed to just going directly to you know the the CEOs of these companies so when we shifted our focus maybe six eight months ago from just going after company you know smile and dialing and sending out emails and called outreach and drips and all of this what we found is you know rather than focusing on the hundreds of thousands of startups what if we focused on the 20 to 30 VC is that we want to build a great relationship with and what if we just focused on delivering as much value as we possibly can to these VC funds whether that be through doing workshops whether that be through making video content of doing spotlights or even having them on our podcast which has been a huge initiative for us the focus has been shifted from just kind of you know sprang out trying to get as anyone we could to focusing on who are the 10 15 20 30 people that we need to know and you know the story I love telling I actually think it was you Steve that really like brought this into kind of fruition or brought this into my mind was around that 34 30 on the ESPN the you right it was actually about the you on this episode and they were talking about who's the coach they were talk do you remember the coach it was one of the Jimmy Johnson there it is they're talking about Jimmy Johnson you know one of the best coaches of his time for for college football and they said you know the reason that Jimmy was so good at recruiting and building you know his team is he quite literally drew a map like he took a piece of paper out and he said something to the effect of if you are you know west of Coral Gables and you're east of us one and you're north of Ponce de Leon you know it but but he basically drew out the grid of Miami and said if you're in this box if you're in the square you are going to know who University Miami is you're gonna know who I am and seeing that ESPN you know documentary really changed my perspective because I started thinking okay if you are a venture capitalist that is north of Rose Ave and south of Wilshire and west of the you know west of Silver Lake you're gonna [ __ ] know who coefficient Labs is one way or another we're going to do our best to add value to the ecosystem to you know try to find ways of helping of getting ourselves out there of coming up with bogus but we are gonna make ourselves known and rather than focus on the entire world we're gonna get really really focused in the weeds and and that has been really the propellant of our team you know relationships are not they're not built overnight they're earned through time through trust and so whether it be through this podcast here filming it you know having the right audio having the best guests we can but I think what we're trying to do now and what I'm so excited for is to position ourselves as key players you know key players in the VC and startup scene whether that's in LA San Francisco New York but I want people to look at co-efficient labs and say yeah they're one of us they know what it's like to get in the trenches they know what it's like to go and you know spend the late nights to to figure out something that's not working to develop the website to make the landing pages better like these guys know what it's like to be on the brink of death and to come back and triumphantly push through you know that's what I want our reputation to be that we hit our goals that were fast that were creative that we're out-of-the-box thinkers that we do what it takes to survive to hit that goal and I believe that we're building that reputation right now and as we are on our own podcast right now demo day it's been really fun seeing the names of the guests that have come through here and being not just a services company that provides marketing and advertising but actually being a group who is facilitating communication in LA and throughout the venture ecosystem so I'm wondering for you somebody who's spent you know a lot of time building company a lot of time selling the service that you have what's it been like having conversations on a weekly basis with top VCS and entrepreneurs uh once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is how I feel about it like each time I sit across from a VC or a founder because we undoubtedly sees and founders there's not been a single episode or I haven't gone away with some notes jotted down and I'm thinking about it and I'm thinking and I'm noodling and I go for my run in the morning and I'm thinking and I'm noodling and yes you know meeting these people building a relationship is been amazing but the learning that I've been you know getting by getting to meet these people has been so rewarding and I think that's you know startup is never the thing that's gonna make you the most money of course you can go into it with an exit right but they always say like if you go into startup thinking you're gonna exit you've already lost from the beginning it should really be rooted in learning and growth being growth minded which includes learning new things so to be able to sit here and talk to you know all of these venture capitalists and for them to talk about their stories and hear the trials and tribulations they went through and that damn like we were actually thinking the same thing and oh wow like that's such a unique perspective it has been so rewarding for me and I also think rewarding for our teammates I mean how often do you know all of us in here get the chance to you know sit down with Bryan Garrett from cross-cut or Lorant from luma or you know Abba from wonderer or any of these amazing amazing funds out here and for us to be amongst these people learning from these people adding value to these people it's just a rewarding ecosystem when I go out and hear that people have been listening to the podcast and it's added value to them or maybe there's a junior associate at a VC fund that now knows his path on how he's gonna become a senior manager or Senior Partner it just makes me feel even better so I I am so bullish on the podcast both for its ability to help distribute and build story around some of these VCS as well as the opportunity for me personally to learn as well as my team to learn yeah I like that instead of going and getting an MBA or a master's in business or anything like that sort of bring business school right right into our office here alright last question what are you most excited for in the coming months I think I am most excited about the team that we're building you know as as a goalkeeper as a soccer player as a businessman you're only as good as their weakest teammate you're only as good as the the members on the on the canoe rowing in the same direction and what Jazz's me up is building teams spreading positivity helping you know those members of my team really find their strains as opposed to trying to level up their weaknesses I'm inspired to put people in a position to succeed awesome well this has been another fantastic addition of demo day how can people get in touch with you Sean at Sean gold patent on the socials at coefficient labs on the socials and at demo day podcast on the socials thank you so much Steve thank you peace guys [Music] you",

    "channel": "CHANCEBENDING",
    "date": "2019-02-25",
    "transcript": "all right welcome to chance bending I am sitting here with Sean go.that and Sean how are you I'm doing so good man thanks for having us here yeah I like it man so Sean you were part of one of the hottest growth firms here in Los Angeles the rumor is you guys are building audience and and building revenue for startups across LA like you're almost like the I love this firm the series a whisper can you confirm is that is that have you have you guys been called the the series a whispers I don't think that I've ever heard a startup call us the series a whispers but I do think that as a team were really positioned well for series a startups that you know maybe they've just hired their head of growth or they have a CMO that's been leading the vision of the team as they begin marketing and they are right in the cusp of maybe getting to that series be round and are looking to scale their paid acquisition channels and I find us to be a really good fit for those series a in series B startups that are looking to really scale out those paid acquisition channels so what you're saying is there are startups out there they're in search of their next round of funding they've probably taken in some funding and they need to hit a certain level of revenue or maybe users and that's when they call you yeah correct I think that what ends up happening in the world of growth or in paid acquisition is um you tend to start you know by utilizing internal resources so maybe you pull your head of product over to come up with some Facebook ads or you bring in maybe your head of operations to think through the right flows for running Facebook ads or Pinterest ads but what ends up happening is most teams that start spending more money you know once you start spending hundreds of dollars a day thousands of dollars a day tens of thousands of day dollars a day what ends up happening is you start exhausting these audiences and so um the difference between Facebook ads and Pinterest ads in all of these digital platforms versus radio and television and newspaper is the feedback loops the amount of data that you're getting in real time is happening at such a different velocity that you're actually able to learn so much faster and so what ends up happening is when you are spending lots of money and your quote unquote exhausting these audiences what ends up happening is your your return on that investment your return on advertising starts to get less and less and so what ends up happening is you as a team need to combat that by testing and so testing new audiences testing new platforms should it be on you know Instagram or Facebook should be an iPhone or Android should be male or female people on the west coast people on the East Coast and so as you start going through these rapid testing iterations you start to realize like I don't have enough team resources to actually execute this at a high level if we start pulling that product designer into ads sessions every week to work across all of these different platforms they're never going to get anything done on product if we have our head of growth spending you know eight nine hours a day trying to upload new Facebook lists or upload new Google AdWords lists then they're not going to be focused on the high level metrics and so I always tell companies or startups that co-efficient Labs is very much in in the weeds marketing team companies are really hiring us to dig deep deep deep into the different platforms and understand what are the levers that we need to pull in order to change their growth velocity I can really relate to that I mean as an entrepreneur my job is I are from zero right like I've built so many different projects where you start from zero you find an audience you start talking to that audience and you're locked it and it's a beautiful moment because you're you're speaking their language and everything is clicking and vibing and the thing starts to grow however there inevitably comes that point when you have to find more users and more audience and more customers and what you're saying is you guys help these startups these larger companies expand their reach and start testing audiences that might be you know a little bit further away from that initial core audience said is it is that right yeah definitely and I think that you know what I love about coefficient labs is um you know we call ourselves a growth hacking agency but but if you really define growth hacking like what is growth hacking for any of your listeners that you know are like well oh cool so Shawn works at a growth hacking agency what exactly is growth hacking if you go on the internet and you start looking around for the definition what you'll find is a lot of different people have come up with their own versions of their own definitions of what is growth hacking but the definition that you'll find the most amongst the top marketers is that growth hacking isn't any one thing or isn't any one job title but rather it's a mindset um growth is a mindset that when you start thinking about everything as as a funnel right like you start at the very top like people first need to they need to see your ad you need to draw them in and gain their attention if you want to sell them something so first you have to show someone in an ad with an impression and then they're gonna click on the ad and then they're gonna go to your website and they're gonna Add to Cart and then purchase but as soon as you think about business in a funnel format in a in a growth minded format um that's when you're able to really move the needle for business but what I have found is it's the exact same thing in life right when you're trying to lose weight when you're trying to meet new people new relationships build your network it's the same exact process of constantly hitting I think what you're talking about is like hitting a ceiling you grow you grow you're you know maybe you're just starting out on Instagram you just started out of business maybe you're in you know sports or you're thinking about maybe starting your own line and you kind of get that first little bump and then things start to stagnate that's like hitting the ceiling and sometimes like you know maybe when you're trying to lose weight you end up hitting that ceiling you've got to come up with new ways to break through I think that um that is where coefficient labs finds itself is right at the point when you know we've tried a lot of different angles and a lot of different avenues but we've hit that plateau and we need a team to come in and really rethink it from the ground up and and that's where we we come in I think that's awesome it it's it's an interesting moment in time here in 2019 because it feels like more than ever if you come up with the right thing at the right time you just blow up so quickly on the other hand in 2019 it's never been harder there is so much content out there there's there's so many voices it's busy you're competing against the entire world how do you think about that like I I just think that for me personally I'm just I'm always striving to find something new and unique and that's becoming harder to do so so how do you as a professional how do you guys think about that as a business so I think there's two specific ways of going about it the first way is something maybe some of your listeners that listen to Gary Vaynerchuk I'll probably end up mentioning his name a couple of times throughout this podcast but for those of you that that followed Gary Vaynerchuk he talks a lot about reverse engineering so a lot of times people that are starting a new business say to themselves like I've got all these ideas that I want to try this I want to try that even on this podcast right we were talking about like what are some cool innovative formats that we could do and so a lot of times people start almost at the very beginning and they come up with all of these ideas that they could that they could do and many many times entrepreneurs don't have the right testing frameworks in place and so they end up going in lots and lots of different directions and a couple months go by three months six months 12 months and they're like where the did the time just go I haven't made that growth and so the first thing that I would talk about is reverse engineering who are the people that you have watched do this have watched grow in you know if you're selling you know chapstick who are other startup chapstick companies that have actually had the same trajectory as you and try to reverse-engineer what they've done and so I think a lot of people start from the get and try to come up with the new way of doing things when really if they take that step back and they reverse engineer what's worked really well and I think that's why you see the videos like Dollar Shave Club that was really really innovative in and of itself but you follow and there's like dollar beard club and all these other videos now are trying to do the exact same thing and the reason is is because it really works and so I think the first aspect for those that are trying to leapfrog when they're first getting started is don't feel like you have to have the original billion dollar idea right off the bat but rather study those that have already been there study those that have already had the same sort of hurdles that you've had and then you will be able to understand like what was it about that campaign that made it work so well and we do that all the time we will analyze our old campaigns from other clients and try to understand what was it about that that works so well and how do we move it into another client or another campaign and so I well the first point is reverse-engineer the second point is actually something that been you had brought up on your podcast maybe one or two episodes ago I can't recall what you talked about these like three key elements of growth or of success and it's learning practicing and understanding and I think like that's something that people even though it makes sense in that framework they maybe don't spend as much time like truly thinking about the importance of it because what makes coefficient labs different or what makes us special is really the fact that we have brought what would normally be considered in product development agile or scrum development or every single week or every two weeks you're working in a sprint so every week we're trying new things we're testing new audiences new creatives new modeling but everything at coefficient labs is all about learning and testing and every single week or testing anywhere between five and 20 experiments sometimes even more on an individual client account and so the first get the first beginning piece is like getting yourself in a learning mindset where you're like I don't know  I don't know anything I'm a beginner here and I think a lot of people that start a business feel like they're the experts or they're the master and so they don't even allow themselves to get into the mindset that lets them learn the second parts about practicing like so many people spend their time sitting in a room thinking about ideas talking to their friends about ideas like what if I do this what if I do that but really like it comes down to executing it and practicing it in trying new things and so um you know one of our core values at co-efficient Labs is to have a bias towards action and testing like when in doubt try try something learn from it practice it and then the most important part to your point is understand it reflect on it why did this work why didn't it work um another tip and I'll throw this as a far third but I yes are the bonus a bonus yes a bonus a bonus tip pre-mortem so pre-mortem this is a term that we use at coefficient labs all the time but most people will do a post-mortem things will go bad for whatever reason and they'll sit around a room like we are right now and say like that didn't work what did we do what could have been what could have gone better right it's that understanding part and while like that is you know a players will get to that understanding part I think that a plus players right that that top percentage will do what we call a pre-mortem and a pre-mortem is where you sit around and you say let's pretend like everything we're about to do this week fails like that this idea we're gonna do just fails miserably what are we gonna do about it what's the learning that we can almost play that game of chess right like if we make this move and then this happens and then this happens like what are we gonna do and I think that by positioning in your head like every week you're sitting down and you're thinking about okay so next week we're gonna be trying these two or three new things so that we could learn so we could practice but what if those things don't work like our clients don't care if they don't work they don't care how hard we're trying and so I think a lot of entrepreneurs wait until things go bad before they start to understand and analyze whereas in some cases you almost want to flip the script and start understanding before you even start learning and practicing because it's all part of the process that's dope I feel like what you're saying I mean it really hits home I know for me and as as I've grown chant spending you know some of the things that I've shared with with our employees is like look we don't know we are going to look at other people and we're going to reverse engineer what they're doing and that's why you'll see us experiment with like Gary stuff you'll see this experiment with everybody Under the Sun will go their way and I don't mind doing that but that's not our goal our goal is to like you say to test and if you're methodical about testing you're going to learn and you're gonna learn ultimately what makes you different and it's your uniqueness that ultimately shines through and that process seems backwards because you would think you would start with how you're unique and then apply it the other direction and and sort of copy people but what I found in start-up life is no you actually start copying people then you apply what's unique and that's happened for me through the pre-mortem through through like thinking through what are we doing and being really exact every every week so I love that and I think that could you give us an example of where a pre-mortem helped you ahead of time yeah so I think that when you're in the world of performance marketing you know something I just mentioned a minute ago like when you're in the agency world or where you're in the servicing service business especially in advertising like there's always a way to paint the pig in a better light but at the end of the day clients have very specific metrics they care about right like lowering the cost per install or lowering the cost per purchase and so when you work like co-efficient labs does in an agile weekly format so every single week for 12 weeks in a row um what what we do is we run in 90 days spring so startups work with coefficient labs on a 90 day sprint and we break that sprint up into 12 weekly sprints so every single week we're coming to the table up you know with our feet held to the fire like are we hitting our goals are we moving towards it or are we moving away from it and so I think that um we're always pre-mortem encountered one of the changes that is that is happening as we speak and I do think that coefficient labs is one of the agencies that's really pushing the tempo in transparency to clients is like the advertising world is a black box um when you work with bigger advertising agencies the real big companies managing hundreds of millions of dollars nones they don't want to they don't want to communicate based on performance they don't want to talk about clicks they don't want to talk about conversions and purchases they want to talk about high level metrics like the amount of impressions or how many people viewed or viewed through on an ad um so I think that the the pre-mortem is is ever evolving like you're constantly checking yourself to see you know if this doesn't work then how are we gonna act and so I guess a perfect example for those of you that are currently running Facebook ads let's say that you're running a Facebook ad and your goal is to get someone to click on that ad and have them fill out you know some information on your website like their name their phone number their email address but let's just say it's like that the end goal is not for them to buy a product but to give you some information many of you have been doing that right maybe you've been sending a bunch of traffic to your landing pages and for whatever reason I don't know 3% 5% 10% 20% of the people um actually become a lead and so traditionally I would go to the client and say hey you know we spend a thousand dollars we got you know 20% of all of the the clicks we got a thousand clicks 20% of them became a lead so we got you you know 200 leads or 20 leads or whatever that is now um a way that you could pre-mortem that is to say okay well let's pretend that that landing page that we're sending people to just doesn't work like this great idea we have doesn't work and those people don't fill out and it's not a ten percent or a 20 percent conversion rate but it's a three percent or a one percent well if that's true or next week and so there are tactics right like there for any of you that are messing around on Facebook ads there's something called a facebook lead ad and what's special about the lead ad is that it actually connects with people's Facebook accounts so if let's say Ben is on Facebook and he's scrolling down and he clicks on Allie dad rather than this ad taking you to a landing page or to a website it's actually gonna pull up this little modal right then in there in the Facebook platform but because Facebook knows what your ID they know what your email address is they know what your phone number is they can actually pull that information directly into the form and so it's an example of you know if our goal is to lower cost per lead and one of our tests is to drive traffic to a landing page we may pre-mortem that out and say if this doesn't work as a back-up plan we're gonna have a lead ad ready to launch on Thursday and that might be able to save us over the weekend and so that's kind of an example of where we may use a pre-mortem to help us for next week that's sweet that I was so excited to have you guys come in here and describe the process to our audience because our audience I just want them to see how much science and how much like this is a real this is probe all right like this is this is this is real deal I appreciate I think what is making I like I think you know as someone that has ego and this is my passion I've been doing this for a really long time um you know I definitely would like to think that we're pushing you know yeah this is this is the pro leagues I would like to think that and we're managing hundreds of thousands millions of dollars of media spend in some cases and so um these stakes are very high the pressure is very high but it doesn't change the process in the process is learning practicing understanding learning practicing understanding over and over and over and over again until you start to see these trends and I think the trends is what feeds into what you were just talking about I think on on the last podcaster on one of them you were talking to a mirror and you were talking to man you you've done your homework on me I I am impressed thank you we you were talking to a mirroring and he was saying something along the lines of how like he wasn't really put on this earth to like be the sales business guy like he's a storyteller he's a creative person and I was talking to Steve as we were listening to that and it's like that's the world that's changing is that there for so long have been all of these creative agencies and that's what they do is they are storytellers they write narratives they come up with protagonists they they have keyed in on how to tell a compelling story but the problem is they're in a totally different world mostly in a different business than the media team in the analytics team and so there's no communication happening between these two teams and so what ends up happening is there's like this kind of old creative way of like this is how it should be done the story should always be like this and I don't care what the data is telling me because it's got to hit these emotions and then you have this newer school like these 19 year old kids you're saying that it's everything's about data and nothing is about the story like that the story is all ego like our people watching it and you know talking about Netflix and like that shit's real when people drop off after 30 seconds because of how you presented content like good luck getting them back and same with podcasts like attention is everything right yeah I think the the lines have blurred right we're like the New York Times in the old days like the the editorial and the business were just completely separate it didn't even know each other and didn't want to know each other and now I think the best performing teams the best performing startups even for me as entrepreneurs like the best entrepreneurs somehow know how to walk the line between business and content and media and and so for me like that's the line I'm trying to walk I view myself as a businessperson first at content creators second but that's no longer in 2019 an excuse for me not to put out amazing creative professional content and so I'm trying to get over that hump and I think it's interesting that you guys are coming in and and helping people I would say you're sort of like not a band-aid because I think that there's a connotation of like there's something wrong but I would say and it's more than glue I think it's this idea of like connecting in a positive long-term manner like what needs to be put together so to speak yeah and I think that it's even its accelerated in that most of these startups right being series a being series be like you have gotten past in many cases that early product market fit like is this even an idea worth looking and so most of our clients are spending thirty thousand a month fifty thousand two hundred thousand dollars more you know and so the idea is less about like is this even an idea that they should be running within more an idea of how do you bring all of this amazing DNA that is your company and and communicate that to your target audience and I think that there's just this this gap between fundamentally understanding the marketing you know the product the positioning the messaging just all of the basic marketing attributes but then you start like getting more complex once you go into the Facebook platform or into Pinterest and you start getting hit with things like character count limits or like your ad can only have 20% text in the ad and you're like whoa well what are all these limitations on the creative or if you use specific words that potentially could you know denounce a specific race or say that that you could actually have your whole advertising account disabled and so I think that there's a misconception around the high level marketing and the low level in the weeds of like how you actually are executing at scale um in a platform that wasn't built really for advertising right I mean advertising came later but Facebook is a social network Instagram is a place for people to share photography so these are really really delicate platforms to work off of but I think it comes back to this you have to marry the data and the creative like to your point before everyone like Gary Vee says everyone has to be a media company now like you gotta have a podcast you gotta have a newsletter you gotta have content but if you I mean look you have employees you have a staff you understand that if I have these editors work for 20 hours that's cost to me right or to you and if no one watches that content well joke's on me and so I better learn what kind of data is telling me who's my audience and and I think that it's such a you know that's a positive of social media is being able to communicate on a daily basis with your actual customers I think there's a ton of negatives surrounding social media but but certainly one of the positives is you have the ability to learn about your customers not just sit in a room with a bunch of other marketing people thinking about it can you guys give us an example of someone you blew up that that you killed it for is do you do you have that we we also have Steve routes route see yes sir Steve route see here from coefficient labs do you do you guys have do you have someone that you that you killed it for that you can talk about just maybe in broad strokes yeah you know a couple companies that come to mind novo which is a banking platform that is specifically built to help startups um founders grow um I think Nova is a great example we're working right now with a company called legacy shields company called connected is really exciting I think connected over the last six months has been a mazing success story for coefficient labs um this is a UH one of the co-founders early early co-founders I don't believe he was one of the first founders but one of the early cofounders of higher calm he was a pivotal labs developer joined hired as one of their first engineering resources and actually started his business I'm taking you ever seen like maybe you have in your house your parents have it like when you walk into a house and there's like a wired alarm system absolutely you know and you go and you've got to push like the two four six eight or whatever your passcode is and like it beeps and then you you know it kind of turns your alarm on and off and so uh if you're like my family or you know people these alarms have been sitting unused stagnant for years and years like everyone has these wired alarm systems but they actually don't use them because they don't pay the monthly bills or whatever and so connect actually took a chip an electronic chip that he built and you take this chip you put it into your circuit breaker and you connect it to a Smart Hub device and you can actually turn your alarm at your house on and off from your cell phone using your old wired alarm system so you don't have to actually get a new unit like a nest or anything but basically you can just have your normal system running and that is a company that we scaled well above $100,000 in revenue per month and they were doing in the mid you know the mid four or five figures so Wow yeah this was a very very big success and excited to see Nate and connected and the team continued to grow as I believe they're launching a series of new products this summer Wow so if my audience is out there and they're like wow coefficient labs Shawn and Steve are just you guys are killing it how should they start to think about if they're sitting there there they might have an idea they might be trying to get something off the ground like what's what's popping in 2019 like what are you guys thinking about like are there platforms are there are there things you're sort of looking at you're like wow I think this is happening right now yeah I think LinkedIn is happening right now for sure yeah I was gonna say I'm just like I'm a hundred percent LinkedIn I mean it's crazy and it's it's a really unique opportunity right now yeah I tell like my little brother who likes to play around with the stocks and like I don't have any money in the stock market but I feel very very very overly bullish right now on LinkedIn um like I did in Facebook 6 years ago I'm watching our clients shifting budget out of AdWords and into Facebook I'm watching them shift budget out of Facebook into LinkedIn a lot of people think that LinkedIn is just a place right now for business connections like it was six years ago three years ago whatever but it is turning into a heavy hitter content platform it's an amazing way if you're in the b2b space to grow your list it's an amazing way to produce content that has a high view count I'm a lot of these channels this is another great piece of advice guys when you hear of a new feature being brought whether it's to LinkedIn or Pinterest or Facebook like whatever the reason is in I'm happy to maybe send you some links on on blogs that we follow to keep in the in the know but when they launch these new features like Facebook live or Instagram live or Instagram live is I'm sorry Instagram TV is now kind of you can integrate it into your organic feed but when they launch something new you got to take advantage of it those are the sorts of things where it's so underutilized there's so the tension going back to attention being everything Facebook and Instagram are motivated to keep your attention on the platform so when they come out with new features and new things for you to try it's totally on you to utilize those and so I think another thing that's really popping right now if you have any clients or if you have any friends or entrepreneur colleagues that are selling products or you know maybe have their own little store Facebook launched a new ad unit maybe eight months ago called collection ads it's almost like a carousel but it sort of has one main feature image or video and then a series of smaller kind of images below it and I would say that you know if you are in the the that space moving away from just doing newsfeed ads and starting to try like canvass ads are trying to start to learn more about these collection ads um not only are they really good effective tools for you to use for advertising but they're new and they're this type of thing that Facebook will give a lot more juice to you'll get a lot more bang for your buck Instagram story ads are you know definitely an area where people could be spending more time building native content for I think that's you know something for for your viewers is to understand that like when you post a ad on Facebook and then you bring that ad in to Instagram and you keep the exact same diameter like the same sizing it's not native and so it looks different on Instagram than it does on Facebook it'll look different on LinkedIn and Twitter and so I think just being as native to the platform as you as you possibly can um is definitely a piece of advice and then I would say the last thing I'll say on this for direct advice is if you are able to get video testimonials I think that kind of the content of 2019 um for let's call it the majority there I think there's two types of couple of this I love this keep going this is great cool so I think there's two types of content that you're gonna see a lot more of this year well let's let's say three types but the two main ones the first are these like 3d pastel drop shadow II kind of you can just tell that the design style is moving to 3d so think like Pixar or like it's it's just moving in that direction coefficient labs is right now in the series of looking into an interviewing 3d candidates um to continue to push the tempo is that like those images you can you can like change your image when you upload to face but like the emoji type so that's an example but I'll show you after the podcasts like some visual examples but you can just tell it's it's different it's we'll put those into the notes sure sure yeah yeah um but for so I would say like that's for like the agency world that's something that we're looking at for our clients because it's different how do we stand out from the crowd and be different um so number one is this 3d pastel style I think that's the design trend of this year I I sent a message out to my team a couple weeks ago and I said guys like this is that this is the trend right here you you need to see it um the second aspect around around this pastel style is in these um low-quality production video content yeah I mean this is what we've been doing actually behind the scenes is like we're doing raw video ads there are the better mm-hmm and the rar the better so and like ease it with like a native Instagram format and Instagram stories and it looks like influencer content and it just performs a million times better than anything else that's right companies come to us right and they'd say like hey so we've got this sort of content like it's been performing really well but we start to stagnate right like we don't have more this is where having a team like coefficient labs is really useful because I think that there are strategic decisions that at a high level maybe feel a little cloudier don't make sense but when you like really dig in you're like oh damn I could see how that works and so an example of that is on Facebook there is something called a video view custom audience a video view custom audience and a custom audience is basically think of it like a bucket of people um you know you personally don't know who these people are but just consider this audience to be a bucket of people and you can create this bucket of people a lot of different ways on Facebook you can upload a list of email addresses and phone numbers that could create a custom audience um you could have your pixel on your website so anyone that hits your website or goes to a specific page that could be a custom audience but what I'm talking right now about is video view custom audience and a video view custom audience says that I'm gonna launch an add a video video ad whether it's on Instagram or Facebook and I want a bucket a custom audience to be made of all people that have watched 75% of this video or more I want a video or I want a custom audience of people that have watched 10 seconds or more of the video and what ends up happening if you really get strategic and you you kind of think like a one or two levels deeper is how do you layer creatives on top of each other using audiences that have already seen bits and pieces of old content so maybe you have someone that watches the entire your your entire segment we then take those people and we put them into a retargeting audience and then every day we feed them a new video testimonial from new people so you know for you Ben maybe after the podcast hey you know this is Shauna has had a great time on Ben's podcast for anyone thinking about you know jumping on you should do it now rather than you showing that spot out to the world people that have never seen me before they've no idea who I am might be a waste of money but if you retarget your current audience with my video they've already consumed some of yours so there's um these are the sorts of tactics right it's not the strategy but it's a tactic of how can you take what a team has already done and sort of growth hackett how do you have you lever so sweet I mean we we have been talking about this idea of like maybe through retargeting we we show through video chance bending like you know I I do business consulting and coaching that we take someone from from nothing to something and we show that through retargeting so that the person gets more information more knowledge and starts becoming successful through the video ads itself and so you see that person go from point A to point B over time yeah yeah yeah I mean I think that it is it's part of the culture and and this is part of the challenges that I have really the biggest challenge that I have is in attribution and in tracking I think that's the the hardest thing to do is to take credit you know if someone sees an ad on Facebook and they click on the ad and maybe they're being driven to a website where they have to buy like a couch or they have to buy furniture it's a thousand dollars but fifteen hundred bucks whatever it is how likely are you you know sitting on the toilet looking at Instagram are you gonna buy right then and there right and so many many many people many marketers many companies depend on multi-touch attribution well they see us on Facebook they watch a little video they click to our website they bounce over to the podcast and they check out Google and then the next thing you know they somehow have come through and they're a lead for your consulting business and so this multi-touch attribution when coefficient labs you know I mentioned we do 90 days sprint so we're fighting for our life for that 90 days it's a core difference that separates us from other teams is you know we don't have a one-year contract we don't have a two-year we have 90 days to prove ourselves and as a result we have to be agile we have to come up with new creatives every week we have to come up with new datasets every week in new audiences every week um that's how we built this business and why I think we're successful because each client is changing client to client and new challenges and Facebook is changing their algorithm what seems to be every week right now but the process of trying new things learning from the data and then understanding and reflecting on how to make it better like that process I think will stay true for years to come so for for our audience out there I don't want them to feel too intimidated and overwhelmed if they're just getting started what's the key idea in principle I mean I I think part of it is just this idea of testing thing do you have advice for people just on a really simple level yes so my first piece of advice for anyone that's getting started or even for people that have already gone started but feel like there's still like a little bit lost on this is to understand that step zero and step one is to ensure that you're tracking and your analytics are set up correctly I can't tell you how many people start by thinking of ideas on how they can grow their company before they have for sure with no question check to ensure that like they're actually tracking this correctly because what ends up happening is you have all of these smart people coming up with all these ideas but then in hindsight they have no way to know if those ideas actually led to the result and so I would say like it's not a shiny thing right it's not like this one particular thing that your viewers should go out and do it should be like if you are listening to this and you're not a hundred percent positive that you've done everything you can to install the right analytics and tracking with your goals and your events like that should be step one and a lot of people think to themselves okay cool so I've got to set this up like where do I get it set up or like who's going to do this for me go to fiverr.com FIV V er I think I think that's what it is but Fiverr yeah yeah two hours two hours five or with two hours go there type in google analytics specialists type in Facebook pixel specialists type in and there are a hundred people for fifteen or twenty bucks that will make sure that this thing's installed so that's like my first it's such dope advice I and it's so true and it's something I had to go through and I love that it's just so actionable which is get tracking setup you get it set up so that way you can get into this mindset of testing get into this mindset of doing things trying things seeing what works seeing what doesn't work because I can tell you I get probably five to ten people a week that are lai-him and I want to start a podcast tell me how to start a podcast and then we inevitably start talking about marketing and trafficking and it's like if you don't know what's gonna work or you don't know where people are coming from and you're like well is iTunes just says I have 25 people like you you you have to understand and once you understand then you can start doing things like I think I just came up with this analogy but I'm digging it right now in my head which is it's kind of like going to the gym without putting on your right shoes like like you just want to get to the gym and start like getting into it and so in the in the heat of like getting to it all you just throw on like whatever kicks you out from work but then you get there and you're like  my ankles hurt or like I don't know why I'm not like getting I'm not able to run as much as I could have run oh I'm wearing the wrong shoes and I feel like that's the sort of thing that's happening in analytics is like they're like ah well let's just get the baseline set up like let's just get it up we'll get the pixel up they say and then like we'll figure it out on the fly six eight months go by things are going well like they know the bottom line is getting better but they don't know if it was because of Facebook if it was because of Valentine's Day if it because of you know this one influencer that made a post and so I would just say is like step zero and one and it's the most unfun step is just make sure that your analytics are set up right if if our audience is having trouble I would just say if there's one thing you could do it is use tracking URLs whether that's bitly or if you understand UTM sort of stuff like just do that that's one and then to use the Facebook pixel and get that thing installed those are the two things I mean there's more but I think those are the two yeah I'm really big they those are those are the two things yeah I mean I'm if you are sitting here listening to this you're like okay I definitely have Google Analytics set up but I'm not sure if I have the Facebook pixel set up or like I think I do but I'm not positive I would go to Google I would type in Facebook pixel helper it's a little Chrome extension it will tell you whether or not you have the Facebook pixel set up it's very very simple it's either green if it's on or not green if it's off um but to Ben's point that's that's the key is um you know as far as analytics is concerned you cannot do any effective if you don't believe in the numbers and you don't believe in that by doing X Y & Z thing it's gonna lead to this result and so knowing your analytics is just it's so so so important it's even more important when you start spending money so when our clients are spending tens of thousands of dollars they need to know where the monies is being put to and I'm sure for anyone that's just getting startup you know that doesn't have venture funding that doesn't have millions of dollars like it's even more important for you to know where your money's going um and I actually think that's the number one reason that people aren't pushing harder on Facebook I do a lot of mentoring for 500 startups and for other accelerator programs and unlike shocked at how many times I'll sit in a room they have an amazing product an amazing team there are Facebook ads when I review and audit their account are working and they're actually making money but because they don't understand this framework of learning and testing and learning and testing they just haven't thought through it they're too afraid to take that step they're like I don't want to spend all this money what if it doesn't work and so I think that this step one in step zero right of getting the analytics set up making sure your Facebook pixel is set up like that's just it's the key and most important but then after that and this is again staying probably too high in the clouds and not enough in the dirt is like this mindset of like testing every week testing every day you know allowing yourself to kind of get back into this mindset of like I have no idea if this is gonna work or not but I'm gonna try it and I'm gonna do it with twenty dollars and because I'm my analytics are set up correctly I'm gonna know if this works it's I think that you know everything else all of the other tactics all of the other quote-unquote hacks all come after you get to this place where a you believe your data and to that you are committed to a ongoing process of learning and testing this is such a good episode I feel like like we've we we are on a journey and if if our audience is listening if you have questions like I feel so passionately about this like literally just DM me or like message me on Instagram if you have a question on this and I'm just gonna paste a link in to you I like but I just feel like we we you need to do this and it's just been a great episode Sean where can people go and find out more about coefficient labs and where about you guys you guys are had a santa monica california we are we are so i'm coefficient labs is out of Santa Monica we're headquartered down on the promenade you can find us at coefficient labs comm you can follow us on the social zat coefficient labs if you're into following kind of the founders journey and the ups and the downs of building a business early mornings late nights you can follow me at shawn colvin um and yeah would would love to connect with any of you off offer online you guys have to watch out for Steve as well Steve is like a master he's everywhere on the internet so he's probably already looking for you ready to talk to you so there's just a little warning like when I came across these guys and I like like man Steve is everywhere Steve what's your what's your official title I'm the director of BC partnerships and when you guys were talking about LinkedIn a little bit earlier I thought I'm pretty sure that's how we met yeah I mean these guys are good these guys are really good like like III feel like it's my job to know who's sort of hacky around in LA and around sort of our space and like why does this name coefficient labs just keep popping up and why is this guy Steve keep popping up and it was like oh my god these guys are everywhere so look I don't like kissing too much ass so I'll just leave it at that but I you know what I just really appreciate you coming in here I feel like you have a bunch of great information for everybody I know there's some stuff I need to get on that you're describing so uh I just appreciate at the time yeah man been really appreciate your time as well and looking forward to the next one we'll have you come over on our podcast Oh awesome let's let's do that and as well next time let's do some video and actually show people some cool stuff cool I actually have a question for you about the the podcasts that we're running I'm curious to know your thoughts on it so we have been kind of noodling around on what like the angle or what's the positioning for us like who do we want to speaking to you on our podcast and in our content in this world of companies and startups that are currently or thinking about or have already gone through the process of going through an accelerator program like Y Combinator mucker labs and the name of the podcast is demo day and the idea is that we would bring on members like yourself that have been through a program or that have been in the world of that in try to help founders prepare for in demystify this idea of demo day how they can set their campaigns up in that you know 12-week period leading up to it and really just kind of from the VCS perspective what's it like going through that process what's it like interviewing these um you know up-and-coming startups I'm curious to know your thoughts just on demo day I'm at in general I'm too niche or do you like where it's going yeah no I love the concept i I think that it's really powerful I mean the the idea that these accelerators try to compact learning into a very short time period and in some sense that's what you would be doing in a podcast so I like this idea of like how much can we squeeze in in a conversation with you all so that if you're out there and you're curious you're learning if you've been through the experience like I have no you know I I do some advising with marker capital and the mucker accelerator program here in Los Angeles but I'm still pretty far away from that you know I went a night I worked with them you know officially in 2012 or 2011 maybe but I'm still as interested as ever in what that is in that process so I would definitely be a listener to that podcast cool but I just think it just needs to be really ash impact and give people the information they need and I you know if as long as you don't make it too fluffy like I don't think people need fluff in that yeah right I think you just you just hit them hard it doesn't matter how long it is either I'm in I'm in I'm cool I'm gonna be a subscriber thanks man you should and hopefully a guest someday as well and a guest also all right guys well next time we're doing video until then until then thanks for having us [Music]",
