1 lunch with Kelly Perdew (Here’s why I did it👇🏻)

Many people asked why I couldn’t just have the meeting over zoom.  

And the answer is simple.

Getting out of the building is where the magic happens. 

Not tucked away behind your laptop.

Not sent from behind a tweet.

But face to face.

When we wrapped lunch — I gave Kelly a giant hug. 

He didn’t ask for it (😂) 

But damn it felt good to make it all the way here.

You can’t always control everything in your business — the tariffs, the AI, the economy — but you sure as hell can care the most.

You can get on that flight.

Book that hotel room.

Hop in that cab!

Jesse Itzler always talks about “make your own luck — and — “control the controllables”.

Well, I made my own luck.

I made it happen.

And now we have a memory for a lifetime. 

No matter what happens with CoEfficient Labs.

I’ll always remember the time I flew to Portugal for a single lunch meeting!

If you want it, go get it!

Back in 2016, I’d walk past Upfront Ventures every morning.

I would say to my teammate Joel…

“Dude! How incredible would it be to work with Mark Suster someday!?”

Year after year would go by…

and one day…

I had the opportunity to meet the one-and-only Kerry Bennett!

We had coffee at a hole-in-the-wall spot outside on the patio - and I immediately knew we clicked.

Our personalities are quite different (certainly our reading taste) - but our love for startups, marketing, and helping founders succeed was almost identical.

Kerry has been a steady beat to the drum of the CoEfficient Labs journey.

In 2020 (weeks before lockdown during COVID) - Kerry gave us a chance to help out with the #UpfrontSummit video.

To this day that project is still one of my favorite memories at CoEfficient Labs - a story for another day.

But fast forward to last night at #UpfrontSummit2025…

My 2016-self would be absolutely freaking out!

Kerry & Mark (and the entire squad behind the LA Tech Community Cares Fund) wanted to find a way to drive more donations for the victims of the LA Wildfires in January.

With the help of dozens of startups & venture capitalists - CoEfficient Labs helped create a fundraising video that raised over $130,000 over the last 2 days!

It was so cool to play a small part in such a big success for the community.

But hearing Mark Suster & Kerry Bennett give CoEfficient Labs a LIVE shoutout in front of the ENTIRE #UpfrontSummit was a moment I’ll NEVER forget.

In fact — I called my mom right after!

”Mom! You’re never going to believe what just happened!”

It was so cool.

Huge thank you to the entire Upfront Ventures team for trusting us (and for throwing one of the best events of the year).

I really love you guys!

The Lesson:

Put your dreams out there to the world.

Then go out there and make it happen! 🔥

Special shoutout to Eric Manlunas for the premonition! 🤣

At #LATechWeek, we asked founders and VCs:

What’s your #1 advice for new entrepreneurs?

Their answers all came back to one thing: networking.

Here’s what they shared:

→ ""Face-to-face connections build deeper relationships.""
→ ""Trust is the foundation of great partnerships.""
→ ""Networking opens doors you didn’t know existed.”

But networking can feel intimidating.

If you’re nervous or introverted, here’s a tip:

💡""Start with something personal.

A simple question, even about the event, can open doors.""

Networking isn’t just about contacts.

It’s about building a community.

So next time you’re at an event, remember:

The resource you need might be the person right beside you.

It could be:
- surviving tough circumstances
- providing for others

On May 28–30, we will be hitting the ground at #SubSummit 2025 — not just as attendees, but as an official social video team for the conference.

I’ll be rolling with:

📹 Joel DeVries – our ace videographer (and my best friend)

🧠 Ethan Harm – our content strategist who built the entire content game plan

(Not pictured but deeply critical):

🤝 David Courtemarche – my right-hand guy at conferences and the king of first impressions

👨‍💻 Ryan Clancy – our remote editor, grinding through the night so we can post daily content

Together, we’ve spent the past few weeks building a content strategy that delivers real-time interviews, daily social clips, recap reels, and testimonial videos for both CoEfficient Labs and SubSummit.

💡 We’ve learned a lot from previous conferences:

- Post content ASAP after filming
- Selfies and thank you videos unlock real relationships
- Testimonial content is gold for event organizers
- And if you're gonna stand out... bring something rare (wait until you see our custom coins!!)

This trip isn’t just about content. It’s about impact:

✅ We’re aiming to meet 400 people
✅ Drive 30 creative briefs
✅ Win 6 new clients
✅ And help SubSummit tell the story of their community

We’ve never been to SubSummit. We’ve never been to Dallas.

And we’ve never been more ready.

Let’s go!!

What is the CoEfficient Labs Mobile you ask?

Well...let me tell you a story!

Since Year 1 of TechWeek -- our team has been running around the city to Spotlight as many events as we possibly can.  

We always try and capture ""The Vibe"" -- get shots of people enjoying themselves, sponsors and logos, we mic up the panelists and get cinema quality footage of every event we attend.  

Our goal is to Spotlight the best events for Tech Week for anyone that's not able to make it, AND for the people that did make it and want a fun piece of content to remember it by -- we got you covered!

One of the hardest aspects of covering Tech Week (and events in general) is editing the footage into a shareable piece of content.

There's just so much happening, and getting the footage back to our editing team to dissect can be one of the biggest time sucks.

So.....

This year -- we brought our editors with us!

Zubin Vidor (our fearless editing lead) offered to convert his Van into a real life editing studio with our other editor Ethan Harm.

The two of them have been putting in 10+ hour days, working out of their Van! 

As someone that loves startups, the hustle, and generally ""just going for it""... I could not possibly be more proud and thankful of these two.

We've had so many people ask if we were running a CIA operation outside the events, but in reality, we're just editing content and making shit happen.

To everyone that has stopped by for an interview, or said ""what's up"" to the CoEfficient Labs team -- we love you guys!

Stay tuned....we got lots more videos coming over the next week.

There’s only one trait of their top 1% founders.

You’ll never guess it 👇🏻

-it’s not being a repeat CEO

-has nothing to do with age

-and every #VC I’ve told this to. 100% agrees.

In our latest clip from Demo Day, TX Zhuo (Managing Partner at Fika Ventures) shares the surprising result of an internal study that reshaped how they evaluate founders.

That one trait 👉🏻 speed of responsiveness.

Is it possible to be a successful company without their founder (and team) being fast to respond?

Of course.

But when Fika ran the #’s (and they had dozens of signals to measure against)…

This was the trait (and only pattern) they found amongst their top 1% investments.

And while this is certainly up for debate…

Think about your interactions in business with different people.

Some people take days, weeks, or even never respond.

They “think” it’s not that big of a deal.

Or maybe they don’t think about it at all —

They’re “so busy”, “so overwhelmed with keeping their company afloat”, or “so focused…”

Whatever the reason — VC’s notice.

Customers notice.

Your Team notices.

I wish I didn’t fall into this bucket.

But sometimes I do.

And when TX mentioned it — it was like a gut punch because intuitively — I get it!

When I send someone an email (especially a candidate I’m looking to hire) — the difference between someone that responds almost immediately or within minutes or an hour of me pinging them vs someone who responds after 2-3 days is palpable.

It’s rare that I think “ohhh, this person doesn’t care.”

But when I get that fast response — I think “ohh, this person DEFINITELY CARES!

So — this is your reminder — and my reminder — that responsiveness matters.

We may not think it matters.

But it does.

👍 “LIKE” if you agree.

♻️ ”REPOST” to remind a friend

🎤 Comment if you disagree & post the trait you look for!

Attending conferences can be overwhelming - but they don’t have to be.

🧠 Here’s how to break the ice and turn those handshakes into opportunities.

1. The Handshake Agreement
- If you’re at a conference, you’ve already agreed to network, whether you realize it or not.
- It’s like the first day of college: everyone’s out of their comfort zone. Be the one to start the conversation, and you’ll be remembered.

2. The 24-Hour Rule
- Conferences move fast. If you don’t follow up within 24 hours, you risk being forgotten.
- Strike while the conversation is fresh - send a DM, connect on LinkedIn, or a voice note to stay top of mind.

3. Stand Out from the Crowd
- Instead of sending a boring email afterwards, get creative with your follow-up. My trick is to record a personalized video. It takes seconds but makes a lasting impression.

CoEfficient Labs tested this approach at #AffiliateSummitWest - and the results speak for themselves.

💰 Our Goal? $10M ARR!!!

(as a bootstrapped startup!)

Here’s the game plan:

Since 2015, we’ve scaled startups with #PaidAds.

In 2022, we launched our UGC Video Bundles.

We’ve had over 900 companies sign-up.

Recently—we discovered a new customer:

📈 Advertising & Performance Agencies.

(just like us)

1️⃣ Agencies need UGC videos to sell
2️⃣ Our software makes this very easy
3️⃣ So we white-labeled it

Now Agencies can sell UGC Videos

(with actors instead of influencers).

They do it under their own name.

CoEfficient Labs makes the videos (behind-the-scenes).

Here’s the math:

100 agencies → 7-10 clients each → $10M ARR.

📱 Stay tuned—we’re documenting our journey.

🎆 2025 starts today. Let’s hit $10M ARR together!

“The things that make the biggest difference in your business will not be in your business plan.”

And that’s exactly what happened with CoEfficient Labs.

We started with a clear mission—

📈 To scale venture-backed startups with paid ads.

But a few years ago, something unexpected happened:

Amid our growth — we found a certain type of creative working much better than every other type of ad we launched.

🚀 UGC videos.

At first, we started making them to help our clients.

But as it turns out, UGC wasn’t just a pivot—it was a game changer.

Fast forward to today and our UGC Video Bundles have turned CoEfficient Labs into a multi-million dollar company.

The lesson?

Stay open to the unexpected.

Don't oversimplify it.

I know, crazy. Most say “don’t overcomplicate it” (read on) 👇🏻

Here’s a few things to keep in mind:

1. Linkedin is 100% a different Ad Platform than it was in 2014
2. B2B has seen massive consumerization (look at landing page designs today)
3. The best targeting options on Meta, TikTok, and Google now live in #LinkedinAds

And even with these changes...

I’m still seeing Series-A, Series-B, and even Series-C companies using the most basic approaches to their #DemandGen strategy.

Does this look familiar?

- Promote an E-book or Webinar
- Offer $100 for ppl to jump on a Demo
- Let the same ads run for months at a time

I audited over 200 portfolio companies this year from the best VC’s in LA and SF, and over 60% of those #B2B companies are still using less than 7 ad creatives in their whole campaign structure.

This is TOO SIMPLE.

If you want to accomplish results that no other team is getting.

You sure as hell better be testing experiments no other team is doing.

Now, do you need to make things super complicated with ‘Lead Scoring?’

No.

Do you need to have a programmatic bidding strategy?

No.

But come on everyone.

We’re heading into 2023.

Step up your game.

At Affiliate Summit West, we walked out with 400+ new leads — and no, it wasn’t luck.

It started with a simple goal:

🎯 100 meaningful conversations each — broken down by day, and even by hour.

Instead of just ""seeing who we’d run into,"" we set a plan:

• 10 convos before lunch
• 10 convos before dinner
• 10 convos before bed

Big goals feel less overwhelming when you break them into small wins.

And that’s the key to making the most out of conferences.

Set your goal before you walk in — then reverse-engineer the path to hit it.

🧠 There are 3 core pillars in scaling a startup.

🗣️ Lead Generation – Getting Leads! 

💸 Sales – Turning Leads Into Customers!

✅ Fulfillment – Delivering on Your Promise!

But before you can sell or fulfill, you need LEADS.

As Alex Hormozi explains in his book #100MLeads,

There are 4 methods to generate them:

1️⃣ Cold Outreach – Connecting w/ Strangers

2️⃣ Warm Outreach – Connecting w/ Ppl You Know

3️⃣ Social Media – Content for your Target Buyers

4️⃣ Paid Ads – Ads to Reach & Retarget Leads

Mastering these methods fuels your sales engine.

Without them, your pipeline runs dry.

And you can’t scale the business.
