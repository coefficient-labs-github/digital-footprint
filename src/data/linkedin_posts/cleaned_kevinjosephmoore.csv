2024 was a successful year for Serac Ventures. We knew starting out that we would be operating in a challenging market (especially from a fundraising perspective) but also reasoned that the cyclicality of the market could work to our advantage. For one, there was a tremendous amount of competition for institutional investors, many of whom are being pursued by established managers. As a small firm, this didn’t matter to us because we weren’t targeting those groups anyway. Secondarily, founder valuations and terms (at the seed stage) have been great for us. We invested in eight (8) companies this year (which was 100% of our target/goal), despite lowering our desired initial investment size. In most cases we were not the largest investor in a round, but we were able to get the same favorable terms as other investors. This would potentially be harder in a “bull” venture market.

From a marketing perspective, we introduced the venture capital asset class to many new investors and successfully added them to our group of highly valued LPs. Just under 70% of our LPs have never invested in a venture capital fund before and nearly 40% came from underrepresented groups. We are extremely grateful for ALL of our supporters, but the democratization of capital starts with access to economic opportunity. As such, we are super excited about demystifying venture capital to make it more accessible to those who may otherwise overlook the asset class.

In 2024, we were able to interact with nearly 4000 founders, either through our inbound or outbound deal sourcing efforts, in-person events, or through our GetFunded weekly office hours sessions (https://lu.ma/getfunded). It’s impossible to invest in every founder we meet, but we believe in adding as much value as we can to help founders along their journey.

Finally, we have no predictions about what’s to come in 2025. All we can do is focus on the things we can control – our attitude, activity, and contribution to founders and investors. 

We are extremely fortunate to get to do this work, so to all our founders, investors, VC friends, and ecosystem builders, we THANK YOU.

Here’s to 2025!

As a former resident of Chicago, the city is like a second home to me. Every time I visit the city ""feels"" the same (in a familiar way) but at the same time it continues to evolve and reinvent itself. I was especially intrigued by the growth of the VC and entrepreneurial ecosystem that has blossomed over the last 10+ years. I have always known about long-time, established VC firms like Hyde Park Ventures and Chicago Ventures. But I was pleased to meet (and reconnect with) several other firms such as M25 Ventures, 1011 VC, Capitalize VC, Rushless For Good, Sandalphon Capital, ATOMS VC, JumpCapital  and Lightbank Ventures (and many others). I also met several founders building high-growth technologies in the biotech, healthcare, hospitality, enterprise SaaS, and fintech sectors. 

I don't know how many VCs and founders you need to have a thriving ecosystem, but I'd say that Chicago has it and continues to trend in the right direction.",2024-07-29 15:40:12,135

For those of us in the VC industry, we all know that there are periods when you spend extended time away on the road at conferences, events, and meeting with founders and LPs. It's a necessary part of the job that you learn to embrace. 

In this post, I thought I'd provide some behind the scenes info of life on the road. 

Monday & Tuesday: On my most recent trip, I flew to Chicago on a Monday evening and on Tuesday I had meetings all day with prospective investors. Immediately thereafter, Brylan Donaldson and I hosted a two-hour, open-house, founder pitch event where we met some amazing Chicago-based founders. To cap off the day, I had the privilege of attending the Black Executive Network dinner hosted by Cooley LLP and met some amazing individuals such as Sidney Peryar, Raymond Rushing, Bobby Earles, and Travis LeBlanc.

Wednesday: I left Chicago on a 5am flight and flew to Dallas where I had the privilege of getting in a morning work out with Lincoln C. Singleton, who I consider one of the sharpest and nicest human beings in the private markets industry. After working out, I attended a series of investor meetings throughout the day and went to the airport that evening to catch a flight to San Francisco.

Thursday: While in San Francisco, I attended the #DiverseVC2024 event hosted by Tim Hsia & Neil Devani. The event was very well attended and all of the panels and panelists were great. Events like these are great for getting face time with LPs and meeting or reconnecting with my VC peers. I also had the chance to connect with one of my Serac Ventures colleagues, Chris Tsakalakis, who lives in San Francisco.

Friday: I said goodbye to SF and jumped on a plane back to OKC. 

This was a fun trip. Over a period of ~3.5 days, I had 15 meetings, attended 2 conferences, and traveled more than 4500 miles (by plane). Traveling like this can be taxing, but I feel extremely fortunate and blessed to get to build Serac Ventures and to do it with great people (Darrel Frater ✝️, Chris Tsakalakis, Brayden Vanover, Devin Brown).

The purpose of VC Day is to build connections in a low-pressure environment to make VC more accessible to all. 

Thank you to Scott McLain, Derek Green, Jon McNaught, & Kevin Fischman who shared some great insights on the LP panel. A few takeaways for founders: 

1). Keep your pitch short.
2). Spend more time telling investors ""who"" you are and not just ""what"" you do.  
3). Stay focused on what you do best and don't try too many things at once.
4). And most importantly, focus on the relationship not just the sale. A ""no"" now could lead to a ""yes"" later.

Thank you to Matt Hickman, Anita Ly, & Matt Waraich who all did a great job on the VC panel. A few takeaways for founders: 

1). Be clear about why you believe YOU are the best person to solve the problem you're trying to solve.  
2). KNOW your numbers and clearly articulate how you plan to make money.
3). Fortune favors the bold! Be confident and take risks, but stay humble and open to advice.

I also had the opportunity to build new relationship with other VCs including Keo Sar, Anthony Herman, Lauren Maillian, Jose Garcia Herz, Isabel Sabadi, and Bhawna B.. 

At the conference there were several panels to attend covering topics such as blockchain, climate, A.I., cleantech, ESG, fintech, and more. I was particularly curious to learn more about hot topics in fintech and what verticals founders and investors were most focused on. The three main topics discussed among panelists were cross border payments, embedded finance, and currency digitization. These categories tend not to be highly problematic in developed markets, but can be difficult to implement in parts of the world with less advanced technological infrastructure. The solutions being developed by founders to address these challenges were intriguing.

Outside of the conference, I was fortunate enough to experience touring Dubai. This was my first time there and I thought it was an incredible place. I look forward to returning at some point in the near future!",2024-10-23 15:25:42,69

At Serac Ventures, we look for founders with big ideas who often lack traditional inroads to venture capital. We embrace founders from all backgrounds and walks of life. What matters most to us is clarity of vision and the entrepreneurial grit to make it a reality. While all of that is “good,” we want to be great. So, we asked ourselves how we can improve as a firm to ensure the makeup of our deal flow and portfolio includes those who have traditionally been left out of the venture capital ecosystem. One of the ways we intend to do that is by increasing the number of female founders in our pipeline who are building companies within our target investment areas. 

To chart a path forward for how we improve, we first needed to know where we were at. If we don’t know where we are we can’t possibly figure out where we want to go. Therefore, we created a report that highlights what’s happening with female founders in the VC industry writ large and how our firm compares to industry averages.  Our number one goal with this report is to be better and hold ourselves accountable. We also want to demonstrate to the industry our intentionality and desire to build an inclusive firm and have a positive impact on the VC industry.

Lastly, I want to give a HUGE shout out to Brayden Vanover who lead the charge on researching, writing, and putting this report together. Great work, Brayden!

Like all asset classes, venture capital can experience highs and lows. During challenging economic periods such as the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) venture capitalists slowed their investment pace as raising capital from institutional investors was challenging and exit activity was sparse. As a result, startups seeking capital during this period had less bargaining power and were forced to lower valuations and cut operating costs. The paradox is that while it was a difficult period for VCs it was also the most favorable time to deploy capital because startup valuations were lower and the companies who survived were stronger as a result. Companies such as Dropbox, Fitbit, Glassdoor, Strava, Airbnb, Groupon, Asana and many others were all started during the GFC and have continued to be highly successful.
 
As shown below, venture returns post the GFC flourished and continued for 10+ years.

At the onset of the COVID pandemic in 2020 venture returns slowed but rebounded to record levels in late 2020 and continued throughout 2021. According to Pitchbook, 2021 was arguably one of the most robust IPO markets for VC-backed companies ever. Now, similar to the GFC, the venture capital industry is in a reset period. With the ZIRP period ending, ongoing concerns about inflation, and heightened political uncertainty, capital has become more difficult to come by and startup valuations have once again decreased. These cycles come and go and for those interested in the sector, it could be a good time to dig deeper.

Given the backdrop of what's happening in the world right now with geopolitics, the economy, and the overall effect on capital markets, I want to post a series of articles about resiliency told from the founder's perspective. 

Over the next four weeks, I'll be sharing four stories from different tech founders who've had to overcome great personal or professional obstacles to build their business. Sure, it would be easy to go to Google and retell the same stories of widely known founders of unicorn companies. But nah. I don't want to do that. I want to take a different approach. I want to share stories of founders that are currently on the rise and making progress, but they're still grinding trying to make it to the top.

If you're a tech founder and you'd like to share your story with me so I can share your journey with the world, please sign up using the link below.

I look forward to diving into this series to motivate founders everywhere to stay resilient and keep growing.

What do you do if your portfolio companies are underperforming?

My response: 

Every startup is inevitably going to encounter problems as they grow. Most early-stage companies struggle with sufficient operating capital, maintaining sales momentum, or finding talent. At Serac Ventures, our goal is to maintain regular contact with founders so that it's easier to see signs of trouble before it starts. This isn't always easy to do, but it's better to expect and plan for problems than be taken off guard by them.",2024-04-11 04:19:39,28

I asked Elmer about the current environment and told him that a lot of LPs have told me they've taken a step back from venture capital because they haven't received distributions in a while. While that may be true, he added that some LPs might also not be allocating the venture because of a high level of existing unfunded GP commitments. 

In many cases, managers that received allocations three or four years ago have not fully invested their capital. Therefore, it's difficult for an LP to invest in another manager when they have large unfunded commitments to existing managers. Additionally, it becomes easier for LPs to tell their existing managers that they're not going to invest in a follow-on fund because the previous funds haven't been at least 70-80% deployed. For example, if a manager is investing out of a 2020 vintage fund that's only 50% deployed and they're currently raising a new pool of capital in 2022, 50% of the 2020 fund will be invested in 2022 vintage companies. It doesn't make sense to commit to both. 

He continued on to say that in times like these liquidity is top of mind for many LPs. But liquidity is only one of three things LPs are concerned about. LPs also care about Returns and Transparency. The degree to which LPs worry about any one of these three points changes depending on the current environment. For example, during the ""gold rush"" of venture capital that we experienced over the last several years, LPs were concerned mainly about returns (i.e., value creation). There was also a period when LPs cared mainly about transparency (e.g., during the Great Financial Crisis). Returns, Liquidity, and Transparency. All are necessary for establishing and deepening relationships with LPs, but the market environment often dictates which of these three is most critical.

Elmer is a consummate professional and deep thinker, and I always enjoy speaking with and learning from him. Thank you, Elmer Huh, for all you do and your contribution to the industry.",2024-06-20 15:00:07,27
