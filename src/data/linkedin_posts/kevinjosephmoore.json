      "text": "An experienced allocator was bearish on venture, so why has she made an investment in an early-stage venture firm? Well, it has to do with that GP building an authentic relationship with the allocator.\n\n\nTune into a brand new episode of Swimming with Allocators, Episode 59, out TODAY!\n\nThis week, I had solo-hosting duties and welcomed two incredible guests: Raudline Etienne, Founder of Daraja Capital, and Kevin Moore, former allocator and Founder/Managing Director at Serac Ventures.\n\nRaudline and Kevin, both with deep experience as LPs and GPs, shared invaluable insights. We explored how allocators new to venture capital can best approach this asset class. A key theme was the critical importance of building genuine relationships between GPs and LPs. It's about substance, not just rushing to close the allocation. Building these relationships takes time, often a significant effort over many months or even years, and can require patience to see results in future funds. It reminded me of when Anurag Chandra shared (episode 42) that asking for advice can often be more productive than immediately asking for money.\n\nOne major takeaway I'm excited for listeners to hear is the powerful perspective shared on networks and the intentional work needed to connect different ecosystems. Similar to when, Lisa Cawley, CFA (episode 36) highlighted, demonstrating you are a \"founder magnet\" and attracting the best is important, and building strong networks is key for sourcing deal flow and getting back-channel references. This focus on being authentic and connecting different communities really resonated with me. The conversation also touched on the value of patience, authenticity, and navigating VC with a contrarian approach, which helps differentiate in a crowded market.\n\nBut that's not all! Don\u2019t miss our insider segment featuring Shane Goudey and Mathew Eapen from Sidley Austin LLP. They join the show to discuss how Sidley helps fund managers navigate complex liquidity challenges, such as those found in continuation funds and secondaries. This involves providing strategic guidance and legal expertise on high-stakes transactions. \n\nTune in for a truly insightful conversation on building relationships, connecting networks, tackling liquidity, and the evolving VC landscape!\n\nLink is in the comments below!",

    "text": "FOUNDER SERIES: STORIES OF RESILIENCY\n\nGiven the backdrop of what's happening in the world right now with geopolitics, the economy, and the overall effect on capital markets, I want to post a series of articles about resiliency told from the founder's perspective. \n\nOver the next four weeks, I'll be sharing four stories from different tech founders who've had to overcome great personal or professional obstacles to build their business. Sure, it would be easy to go to Google and retell the same stories of widely known founders of unicorn companies. But nah. I don't want to do that. I want to take a different approach. I want to share stories of founders that are currently on the rise and making progress, but they're still grinding trying to make it to the top.\n\nIf you're a tech founder and you'd like to share your story with me so I can share your journey with the world, please sign up using the link below. \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gHZbgvKM\n\nI look forward to diving into this series to motivate founders everywhere to stay resilient and keep growing.\n\nPhoto by Alex Gisby on Unsplash of a lone tree thriving in the desert. Perfect example of a resilient founder!\n\nPlease share this post with any tech founder you think might be interested.\n\nChris Tsakalakis, Devin Brown, Brayden Vanover, David Rodr\u00edguez, Miral Tripathi, Brylan Donaldson",

    "text": "Apollo released a chart that highlights how modern portfolios are constructed (below). Note that \u201cActive\u201d was eliminated and replaced with \u201cFixed Income Replacement\u201d and \u201cEquity Replacement.\u201d In a separate earlier article, Apollo stated that 60/40 portfolios that follow the S&P might be skewed due to the heavy influence of tech stocks. As such, modern portfolios are designed to balance effects such as this. As a VC, I find it particularly intriguing (and ironic) to see the inclusion of alternatives as a way to balance portfolios given that most people lack access to this asset class (especially the venture asset class). One innovative strategy I'm learning more about are interval funds that offer investors exposure to VC/PE and public stocks in the same portfolio. More importantly, you don't always have to be an accredited investor to participate in them.",

At Serac, we invest in seed-stage companies, and I use this frequently in my conversations with LPs to explain how stage dynamics have changed at seed. Our thesis is that technology, remote work, and easier access to industry experts has accelerated the progress companies can make prior to raising their seed round, and hence, they are able to raise larger financing rounds. Yes, during this research period the fundraising environment was far more robust than it is now, but the overall trend of companies achieving more, earlier, continues.\n\nLink to article below:\nhttps://lnkd.in/gnZzApCM",

    "text": "Serac Ventures - Year in Review\n\n2024 was a successful year for Serac Ventures. We knew starting out that we would be operating in a challenging market (especially from a fundraising perspective) but also reasoned that the cyclicality of the market could work to our advantage. For one, there was a tremendous amount of competition for institutional investors, many of whom are being pursued by established managers. As a small firm, this didn\u2019t matter to us because we weren\u2019t targeting those groups anyway. Secondarily, founder valuations and terms (at the seed stage) have been great for us. We invested in eight (8) companies this year (which was 100% of our target/goal), despite lowering our desired initial investment size. In most cases we were not the largest investor in a round, but we were able to get the same favorable terms as other investors. This would potentially be harder in a \u201cbull\u201d venture market.\n\nFrom a marketing perspective, we introduced the venture capital asset class to many new investors and successfully added them to our group of highly valued LPs. Just under 70% of our LPs have never invested in a venture capital fund before and nearly 40% came from underrepresented groups. We are extremely grateful for ALL of our supporters, but the democratization of capital starts with access to economic opportunity. As such, we are super excited about demystifying venture capital to make it more accessible to those who may otherwise overlook the asset class.\n\nIn 2024, we were able to interact with nearly 4000 founders, either through our inbound or outbound deal sourcing efforts, in-person events, or through our GetFunded weekly office hours sessions (https://lu.ma/getfunded). It\u2019s impossible to invest in every founder we meet, but we believe in adding as much value as we can to help founders along their journey.\n\nFinally, we have no predictions about what\u2019s to come in 2025. All we can do is focus on the things we can control \u2013 our attitude, activity, and contribution to founders and investors. \n\nWe are extremely fortunate to get to do this work, so to all our founders, investors, VC friends, and ecosystem builders, we THANK YOU.\n\nHere\u2019s to 2025!\n\nPicture below (L to R) Darrel Frater \u271d\ufe0f, Kevin Moore, and Devin Brown.\n\nAdditional Serac Team: Chris Tsakalakis, Brayden Vanover, Brylan Donaldson",

      "text": "Ever wondered why less than 1% of venture capital goes to Black and women founders?\n\nThe bottleneck that no one talks about lies at the top of the funding chain.\n\nSimply put: LP dollars are not flowing to fund managers who actually back diverse founders.\n\nThis needs to change.\n\nThe more dollars that go to these managers, the more dollars that reach underrepresented founders. It\u2019s imperative that we support initiatives and fund managers who prioritize diversity, and hold bad actors accountable.\n\nThank you, Black Enterprise Magazine, for partnering with Kevin Moore and me to shed light on this critical issue.\n\nPlease read this article and share your thoughts.\n\nHave a blessed day!\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gyk4eSpb",

Ensure it\u2019s significant, timely, and not trivial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2. **Solution**: Describe your offering and how it solves the identified problem. Include details on your business model.\n\n3. **Market Size**: Present the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM). Be realistic about your market share potential - hint, it's not more than 30%.\n\n4. **Competitive Advantage**: Showcase how your solution stands out against competitors. Use comparison matrices or feature tables.\n\n5. **Traction**: Provide evidence of your startup's growth\u2014annualized revenue, customer numbers, or retention rates.  Awards and advisors are not as interesting.\n\n6. **Team**: Highlight the strengths and experiences of key team members, particularly the founders and CEO.\n\n7. **Funding Request**: Specify how much funding you seek and detail its intended use. Be transparent about your valuation with the realization that investors set values.\n\n**Bonus Tips**: Make your pitch deck easily accessible (avoid restricted links), and consider including customer feedback or case studies as nice-to-haves.\n\nIf you\u2019re in fintech, B2B SaaS, or commerce enablement and ready to seek seed stage funding, please consider Serac Ventures and provide your information at https://lnkd.in/gH29ujWE \n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Prepare your pitch deck with these fundamentals in mind, and increase your chances of securing the funding you need! \n\n#Entrepreneurship #PitchDeck #VentureCapital #Funding #StartupAdvice",

    "text": "I want to express my sincere gratitude to Farhan Lalji, Omar Hassan, and the Global Growth Hub for the invitation to Expand North Star & GITEX conference held in Dubai last week. At the conference I had the opportunity to meet several talented founders including Emre Akyel, Jacek Figula, Alexander Morsakov, Rafael Sola, and Frank Malek. I also had the opportunity to build new relationship with other VCs including Keo Sar, Anthony Herman, Lauren Maillian, Jose Garcia Herz, Isabel Sabadi, and Bhawna B.. \n\nAt the conference there were several panels to attend covering topics such as blockchain, climate, A.I., cleantech, ESG, fintech, and more. I was particularly curious to learn more about hot topics in fintech and what verticals founders and investors were most focused on. The three main topics discussed among panelists were cross border payments, embedded finance, and currency digitization. These categories tend not to be highly problematic in developed markets, but can be difficult to implement in parts of the world with less advanced technological infrastructure. The solutions being developed by founders to address these challenges were intriguing.\n\nOutside of the conference, I was fortunate enough to experience touring Dubai. This was my first time there and I thought it was an incredible place. I look forward to returning at some point in the near future!",

    "text": "Sometimes people ask me what it takes to run a venture capital firm and I tell them that while it's a lot of fun, it's also a lot of work. For those of us in the VC industry, we all know that there are periods when you spend extended time away on the road at conferences, events, and meeting with founders and LPs. It's a necessary part of the job that you learn to embrace. \n\nIn this post, I thought I'd provide some behind the scenes info of life on the road. \n\nMonday & Tuesday: On my most recent trip, I flew to Chicago on a Monday evening and on Tuesday I had meetings all day with prospective investors. Immediately thereafter, Brylan Donaldson and I hosted a two-hour, open-house, founder pitch event where we met some amazing Chicago-based founders. To cap off the day, I had the privilege of attending the Black Executive Network dinner hosted by Cooley LLP and met some amazing individuals such as Sidney Peryar, Raymond Rushing, Bobby Earles, and Travis LeBlanc.\n\nWednesday: I left Chicago on a 5am flight and flew to Dallas where I had the privilege of getting in a morning work out with Lincoln C. Singleton, who I consider one of the sharpest and nicest human beings in the private markets industry. After working out, I attended a series of investor meetings throughout the day and went to the airport that evening to catch a flight to San Francisco.\n\nThursday: While in San Francisco, I attended the #DiverseVC2024 event hosted by Tim Hsia & Neil Devani. The event was very well attended and all of the panels and panelists were great. Events like these are great for getting face time with LPs and meeting or reconnecting with my VC peers. I also had the chance to connect with one of my Serac Ventures colleagues, Chris Tsakalakis, who lives in San Francisco.\n\nFriday: I said goodbye to SF and jumped on a plane back to OKC. \n\nThis was a fun trip. Over a period of ~3.5 days, I had 15 meetings, attended 2 conferences, and traveled more than 4500 miles (by plane).

    "text": "The purpose of the Serac Ventures Guild is to help Serac portfolio companies with strategic needs as they grow. The intent is to help founders connect with experienced professionals who can help them navigate roadblocks and accelerate their growth.\n\nGuild member, Carey Flack \u2728, is a Growth Product Manager at Adobe. With a past life founding startups, executing research and launching products at Adobe, BuzzFeed Tasty, and Drip we are excited to have her as a member of the Serac Ventures Guild.\n\nTell us a little about yourself: \nI am an International Growth Product Manager at Adobe, where I run A/B experiments that mindfully launch and nurture Adobe products across global markets. Our experiments have earned $12 million in annual recurring revenue and 1M+ incremental engagements across Adobe\u2019s business. Prior to a career in tech, I founded two startups: BLOOM and Roomswap.\n \nTell us a little bit about your background:\nI grew up in Metro Detroit, Michigan. In 2011, I returned to my roots in Oklahoma to earn a Bachelor of Business Administration in Entrepreneurship with a minor in Black Studies and an MBA with a focus on Strategy, Technology, and Design from the University of Oklahoma. Here, I discovered a passion for building community-based tech projects. For years, I enjoyed being a mentor for diverse startup founders and Product Managers in the Technology space. \n\nWhat type of work are you involved in?\nMy role at Adobe involves running A/B experiments that increase revenue and engagement KPIs across global markets outside of the US. This involves driving yearly International Strategy for Adobe\u2019s growth organization. Before Adobe, I was a Product Manager who regularly interpreted user feedback and worked with designers to execute on new user experiences. I am also an educator at the School for Poetic Computation, where I help technologists create media projects with the humanities and society in mind. \n \nWhy are you excited about being a part of the Serac Guild?\nSerac Ventures and the Guild aligns with everything I believe in; bringing startup infrastructure and support to the Heartland, supporting the creation of startups that help advance our collective future with cutting edge technologies, and helping non-traditional founders get the mentorship they need to succeed and bring their dreams to life. Launching a startup is rewarding, but also difficult work. This is an opportunity for founders to get critical guidance that pushes their work forward. \n \nWhat is one piece of advice you have for founders?\nMy advice for founders is to create opportunities for honest user feedback to better understand how they are experiencing your product. Maintaining a clear line of communication with users and truly understanding their pain points, how your product is working for them and what could be improved is a powerful way to build the best overall product experience faster. The 5 W\u2019s are helpful questions to ask when interpreting user feedback.",

    "text": "I had a great time attending the TechChicago Week events in Chicago last week. As a former resident of Chicago, the city is like a second home to me. Every time I visit the city \"feels\" the same (in a familiar way) but at the same time it continues to evolve and reinvent itself. I was especially intrigued by the growth of the VC and entrepreneurial ecosystem that has blossomed over the last 10+ years. I have always known about long-time, established VC firms like Hyde Park Ventures and Chicago Ventures. But I was pleased to meet (and reconnect with) several other firms such as M25 Ventures, 1011 VC, Capitalize VC, Rushless For Good, Sandalphon Capital, ATOMS VC, JumpCapital  and Lightbank Ventures (and many others). I also met several founders building high-growth technologies in the biotech, healthcare, hospitality, enterprise SaaS, and fintech sectors. \n\nI don't know how many VCs and founders you need to have a thriving ecosystem, but I'd say that Chicago has it and continues to trend in the right direction.",

    "text": "I've posted on cybersecurity before, but it continues to be a subject that intrigues me because it affects so many of us in personal and professional ways. In the most recent Pitchbook Venture Monitor report, Dan Schulman, former president and CEO of Paypal, said \"Cybersecurity is one of the biggest existential threats we face.\" He goes on to say that \"There are really only two types of companies: companies that have been breached or hacked and those that don't know they've been breached or hacked.\" It's impossible to say with certainty if this last statement is true, but his point is well-taken in that no company using technology at a high-level is immune. \n\nIn Crowdstrike's 2024 Global Threat Report, they state \"Researchers and academics have further speculated that threat actors will almost certainly use generative AI tools in information and influence operations in the near future.\" And, \"AI\u2019s continuous development will undoubtedly increase the potency of its potential misuse \u2014 particularly within the scope of information operations and especially for less digitally literate audiences.\"\n\nCyber threats are not going away and have unfortunately increased in recent years. My prediction is that demand will increase for founders building technology solutions to help companies be more secure and stop cyber criminals. It's a highly technical endeavor, but a solvable one.\n\nSources below:\n\nPitchbook Venture Monitor Report:\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g2AaccHX\n\nCrowdstrike 2024 Global Threat Report:\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gPqSJVeJ",

    "text": "Why Now is a Great Time to Explore VC\n \nLike all asset classes, venture capital can experience highs and lows. During challenging economic periods such as the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) venture capitalists slowed their investment pace as raising capital from institutional investors was challenging and exit activity was sparse. As a result, startups seeking capital during this period had less bargaining power and were forced to lower valuations and cut operating costs. The paradox is that while it was a difficult period for VCs it was also the most favorable time to deploy capital because startup valuations were lower and the companies who survived were stronger as a result. Companies such as Dropbox, Fitbit, Glassdoor, Strava, Airbnb, Groupon, Asana and many others were all started during the GFC and have continued to be highly successful.\n \nAs shown below, venture returns post the GFC flourished and continued for 10+ years.\n \nFund Vintages/IRR (Source: Cambridge Associates, as of 6/30/2023)\n2009 - 12%\n2010 - 19%\n2011 - 16%\n2012 - 16%\n2013 - 16%\n2014 - 17%\n2015 - 16%\n2016 - 19%\n2017 - 23%\n2018 - 20%\n2019 - 15%\n2020 - 11%\n\n**Median IRR over this period - 17%\n \nAt the onset of the COVID pandemic in 2020 venture returns slowed but rebounded to record levels in late 2020 and continued throughout 2021. According to Pitchbook, 2021 was arguably one of the most robust IPO markets for VC-backed companies ever. Now, similar to the GFC, the venture capital industry is in a reset period. With the ZIRP period ending, ongoing concerns about inflation, and heightened political uncertainty, capital has become more difficult to come by and startup valuations have once again decreased.

    "text": "SERAC VENTURES FEMALE FOUNDERS REPORT\n\nAt Serac Ventures, we look for founders with big ideas who often lack traditional inroads to venture capital. We embrace founders from all backgrounds and walks of life. What matters most to us is clarity of vision and the entrepreneurial grit to make it a reality. While all of that is \u201cgood,\u201d we want to be great. So, we asked ourselves how we can improve as a firm to ensure the makeup of our deal flow and portfolio includes those who have traditionally been left out of the venture capital ecosystem. One of the ways we intend to do that is by increasing the number of female founders in our pipeline who are building companies within our target investment areas. \n\nTo chart a path forward for how we improve, we first needed to know where we were at. If we don\u2019t know where we are we can\u2019t possibly figure out where we want to go. Therefore, we created a report that highlights what\u2019s happening with female founders in the VC industry writ large and how our firm compares to industry averages. \u00a0Our number one goal with this report is to be better and hold ourselves accountable. We also want to demonstrate to the industry our intentionality and desire to build an inclusive firm and have a positive impact on the VC industry.\n\nTo access the report, please download it here: https://lnkd.in/gjs_ufDH\n\nLastly, I want to give a HUGE shout out to Brayden Vanover who lead the charge on researching, writing, and putting this report together. Great work, Brayden!\n\n#FemaleFounders",

    "text": "I want to thank Elmer Huh for sharing his many years of wisdom with me on a call I had with him this week. I asked Elmer about the current environment and told him that a lot of LPs have told me they've taken a step back from venture capital because they haven't received distributions in a while. While that may be true, he added that some LPs might also not be allocating the venture because of a high level of existing unfunded GP commitments. \n\nIn many cases, managers that received allocations three or four years ago have not fully invested their capital. Therefore, it's difficult for an LP to invest in another manager when they have large unfunded commitments to existing managers. Additionally, it becomes easier for LPs to tell their existing managers that they're not going to invest in a follow-on fund because the previous funds haven't been at least 70-80% deployed. For example, if a manager is investing out of a 2020 vintage fund that's only 50% deployed and they're currently raising a new pool of capital in 2022, 50% of the 2020 fund will be invested in 2022 vintage companies. It doesn't make sense to commit to both. \n\nHe continued on to say that in times like these liquidity is top of mind for many LPs. But liquidity is only one of three things LPs are concerned about. LPs also care about Returns and Transparency. The degree to which LPs worry about any one of these three points changes depending on the current environment. For example, during the \"gold rush\" of venture capital that we experienced over the last several years, LPs were concerned mainly about returns (i.e., value creation). There was also a period when LPs cared mainly about transparency (e.g., during the Great Financial Crisis). Returns, Liquidity, and Transparency. All are necessary for establishing and deepening relationships with LPs, but the market environment often dictates which of these three is most critical.\n\nElmer is a consummate professional and deep thinker, and I always enjoy speaking with and learning from him. Thank you, Elmer Huh, for all you do and your contribution to the industry.",

      "text": "Kevin Moore, founder and Managing Partner of Serac Ventures, spoke to #VCI\u2019s 2024 fellows last week about his fund thesis, fundraising strategy, keeping his mental health strong throughout the long-term process of building a fund, and much more. Among his many pearls of wisdom, he illuminated his communications approach, saying \u201cWhen people know a lot about something, they tend to say a lot less.\u201d\n\nFirst-time fund managers sometimes make the mistake of believing that the more they talk, the more knowledgeable they sound. They often want to say everything they can to convince potential investors to believe in them. But saying less is often more. It's imperative to be very intentional and selective in what you say in your pitch. Try to resist the urge to speak about everything the first time you meet someone. The potential investor will need to take time to get to know you anyway, so focus on giving the bullet point overview. If they still have interest, you will be able to share more later!\n\n#diversityandinclusion #impactinvesting #esg #fundmanagers #venturecapital #DiversityInVC\u00a0#ImpactinAction\u00a0#emergingmanagers #alternateinvestments #vc #pe #dei",

    "text": "My team and I Serac Ventures have been discussing genAI's growth and importance to founders and investors. In our weekly deal flow meeting, it seems that nearly every company we review has some AI-enabled feature integrated into the product or service. Pitchbook recently released its Emerging Spaces in Review Tech Research Report. In 2023, genAI led all sectors in deal value and deal count across all venture stages, early, late, and growth. Given all the attention to the sector, it's plausible to ask whether we are in the middle of an enormous hype cycle that will eventually die out. Or is this a legitimate paradigm shift into an AI-driven future? genAI is an amazing technology that is universally applicable across sectors, so I'm inclined to thinks it's the latter. But it'd be great to hear other viewpoints.\n\nPitchbook report: \nhttps://lnkd.in/gz6kiqRF",

    "text": "The most effective way to build strong relationships with founders is through assertiveness. For example, this past week I met with a founder and told him that there was a major disconnect between the product he's building and the customers he's targeting. It took a few meetings to reach this conclusion. However, I knew it was imperative to let him know the company was not ready for investment until he figured this out.  I felt extremely frustrated for the founder because someone should have told him sooner. This would have allowed him to spend his resources fixing this core problem, but instead, they continued to develop the product thinking they were on the right path. \n\nBuilding a company is hard and many founders have just one shot to get it right. If founders can't trust investors to be open with them, then there's no value to the relationship.",

    "text": "Question of the Week:\n\nWhat do you do if conflict resolution is disrupting team dynamics in your Venture Capital firm?\n\nResponse:\n\nThis question applies to all firms, not just venture capital. I don't know what the \"ideal\" way is to deal with conflicts, but I do know that the \"worst\" way to resolve them is to avoid them. Conflict resolution begins with acknowledging the conflict, discussing it with the parties involved, and finding a solution (or middle ground). Venture capital firms have the additional challenge that team sizes are usually very small and relationships among team members can be highly personal. I also think there can be a negative compounding effect when teams are 100% virtual leaving few opportunities to discuss conflicts without the helpful nuances of human nature. Developing internal policies to resolve conflicts is a great way to ensure they're addressed rapidly and systematically.",

    "text": "Question of the week:\n\nWhat do you do if your portfolio companies are underperforming?\n\nMy response: \n\nEvery startup is inevitably going to encounter problems as they grow. Most early-stage companies struggle with sufficient operating capital, maintaining sales momentum, or finding talent. At Serac Ventures, our goal is to maintain regular contact with founders so that it's easier to see signs of trouble before it starts. This isn't always easy to do, but it's better to expect and plan for problems than be taken off guard by them.",

    "text": "LinkedIn Question of the Week:\n\nWhat do you do if you want to improve decision-making in Venture Capital through delegation?\n\nMy Response:\n\nThe best way to improve decision-making in venture capital is to establish a culture of collaboration and transparency. One of the mistakes I made early in my VC career was siloing myself when evaluating investment opportunities. I would think I was making progress in due diligence only to find out later that my partners weren't aligned. Seeking feedback early and often accelerates the DD process and eliminates blind spots. There's a proverb that says in the multitude of counselors there is wisdom. For VC firms, or really any organization, this couldn't be truer. Our team meets once a week to review opportunities and at the end of our meetings we know very clearly who's doing what. Regular communication and clear objectives is what works.\n\nPhoto by charlesdeluvio on Unsplash",

    "text": "Thank you to everyone including the VCs, LPs, founders, and ecosystem builders for coming out to #VCDayOKC. The purpose of VC Day is to build connections in a low-pressure environment to make VC more accessible to all. \n\nThank you to Scott McLain, Derek Green, Jon McNaught, & Kevin Fischman who shared some great insights on the LP panel. A few takeaways for founders: \n\n1). Keep your pitch short.\n2). Spend more time telling investors \"who\" you are and not just \"what\" you do.  \n3). Stay focused on what you do best and don't try too many things at once.\n4). And most importantly, focus on the relationship not just the sale. A \"no\" now could lead to a \"yes\" later.\n\nThank you to Matt Hickman, Anita Ly, & Matt Waraich who all did a great job on the VC panel. A few takeaways for founders: \n\n1). Be clear about why you believe YOU are the best person to solve the problem you're trying to solve.  \n2). KNOW your numbers and clearly articulate how you plan to make money.\n3). Fortune favors the bold! Be confident and take risks, but stay humble and open to advice. \n\nI also want to thank our sponsors, Peter Mullen at Regent Bank and Jake Ornstein at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP. We greatly appreciate your support!\n\nLastly, huge shout out to Cindy Ho at Stout Street Capital and to my team at Serac Ventures - Darrel Frater, MBA \u271d\ufe0f, Whitney Kovash, & Brayden Vanover - for making this event a huge success.",
