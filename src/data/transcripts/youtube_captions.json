    "transcript": "this is the build Tech stack Equity podcast we dive into the inspiring stories of underrepresented tech entrepreneurs and investors this episode is courtesy of Torro AI the number one recruiting firm for software development and AI Talent all right Kevin welcome to the show I appreciate you taking some time out to join us thank you thank you for having me absolutely so fund manager at sarak ventures before we get to that though I do want to learn a little bit more about you and talk about kind of your path I know you spent a bunch of time on the investment side but you know to give cont give folks context into who you are in your professional career would love for you to give us some background I'll give the high level first okay and then we can dig in deeper as you see fit I actually got my degree in civil engineering and I always like to tell people my path to becoming a venture capitalist was not traditional and I'm glad it wasn't because I learned so many different things along the way from an engineering perspective process order super helpful and understanding what I do now and then from there I went to become a financial advisor first at Northwestern Mutual and then second at Morgan Stanley learned a lot at different each of those locations and then from there I transitioned into the regulatory side I went to work for the Federal Reserve Bank while I was going back to school then I got into Venture and started at a seat stage firm here in Oklahoma City where I am and then worked on the lp side of venture at a venture capital fund of funds before deciding to launch my own Venture Capital fund SRA Ventures all of that happened over a course of 17 years so lots to pull apart there but that's the high level yeah so you know I think it's interesting even you mentioning you have a a non-traditional path to venture a ton of folks want to learn how do I get into Venture one way you know folks have taken the founder path had an exit decided to move in and on the fund manager side you were kind of you mentioned being a Federal Reserve correct and then transitioning into Venture so how does that actually I mean I understand it's still Finance of some sort but they're kind of two different worlds yeah I think what I've seen in my Venture Capital careers is that most people have these eclectic backgrounds whether they were a founder or they were an operator or they worked outside of the industry I've met a lot of attorneys who became VCS a lot of psychologists who became VCS people who were like poai or history whatever it might be I think ultimately what it boils down down to is are you able to Source good opportunities do you have a very curious mind and can you think about problems differently and then also probably the most important is are you able to actually invest one of the things that I feel like I've done a really good job of in my career is selecting Investments using a framework of how to think about the opportunity so whatever the medium was the medium just changed so if it was investing in a stock or real estate or whatever it was creating a disciplined approach to how you do that and then following that is the way to success I I think my first the interest of investing in general started 2005 is right after I graduated college right and a week after graduating I moved to Chicago had my first real job was getting my first real paycheck and I thought man you know what I didn't grow up with much money I need to do something responsible with this money so I started invested into I open up a brokerage account it's now Charles Schwab but at the time it was Scott Trade okay I just started buying I just started buying stocks of the companies I was using on a daily basis like I bought apple and sandis and CVS just stuff like that and said to myself okay each time I'm up a certain percent on a position I was going to sell that position and take my rewards no matter what was happening so I did that consistently over a couple of years and did pretty well and said to myself man you know what if I can develop this sort of investment strategy for myself and be successful at it maybe I can do that for other people and that's what got me on the path to wanting to get into finance and then there it was the same sort of decision making and strategy process with every single medium thereafter whether it was investing in Venture Capital funds investing in early stage companies I own investment properties so whatever it is just like deciding on a framework sticking to it and really that sort of way of thinking helps you as an investor and I think helps people to really think about oh if I'm G to get into VC or private Equity or whatever you got to be able to think like that right and so that first role you had as a VC or at the VC firm what did it look like I mean I know it can look various ways depending on where you are was it more hey let me go out and Source deals let me be the one that's fetting the deals let me kind of establish some sort of thematic approach to potential companies we look at curious what it looked like that first role you had within BC so the first firm I worked at was a organization called i2e which is short for Innovation to Enterprise and when I came there I had a role of being I called it a venture advisor which is kind of like a associate position and then I was also managing an in-house group of investors that they had put together that would co-invest with us into our deals and that was I was effectively the director of Angel Investments so I was managing that group and helping to Source deals for them but as a venture adviser it was the same thing the Mandate we had as an organization was to invest in Oklahoma based technology companies so that's what we were looking for with within that we invested in biotech companies and then just other technology companies I'm not an expert in life sciences or Healthcare so I didn't focus on those types of companies but all the rest of them I did did so it wasn't just sourcing them when we found them we were helping them with their financial modeling with their sort of operations finding Talent just sort of the standard things right but there was a lot of Hands-On work because these companies were very early stage right but you know so much of this stuff in Venture I think in just about business is just self-taught and if you have there's so much information out there now where if you want to learn how to invest there's very little barrier to entry to figure that out the hard part is actually getting the opportunity right but obtaining the information that's just something you control so I had been doing that for years studying the industry trying to figure out how to get into it and at the Federal Reserve part of what I took away from that role was we were we would go into these banking institutions and they would hand us a portion of their loan portfolio and we would sit down and go through each one of those companies and just figure out is this a good company that the bank actually made a loan to and it was through that process where I started to understand one how the money system worked and two how companies actually leveraged up how they operated and do did all these different things I never thought I would get that type of takeaway from working there but it was like cons it was like Consulting to a certain degree because you really had to understand what was happening in order to assess whether the bank was doing a good job of giving people money which in essence is not Venture it's more debt but it's the same sort of concept of are they validating this company well enough to give them Capital yeah and on the Venture side it's both debt and Equity but usually more Equity right yeah that's interesting because the experience I had and and I remember specifically moving from from Investment Banking and then over to the private Equity growth Equity side and you know on the investment banking side you're doing a lot of analysis but ultimately you're you are the advisor you are the middleman you're trying to get a transaction done when you move over to the buy side VC growth Equity PE the core question is this a good business right and so that leads to an entirely different way of thinking right which is what you reminded me of as your exp explaining your experience at the Federal Reserve you know looking at loan portfolios and saying is this a good business yeah absolutely so I mean I think early on in my career and younger people will ask me what do I need to do to move up in my career or get adventured and I'm like you know one there's no linear path in life in general I can talk more about the personal stuff if you want but I always tell people that the Epiphany I had when I was six months into my job at the FED which was challenging for me because I'm like super outgoing and that job is very analytical you're kind of isolated I was like I hate this job like why am I here why am I doing this then I heard this voice like this voice in my head that said you know wherever you are be there and I thought what does that mean the takeaway was it's like whatever you're doing try to add and also extract as much value from it as you possibly can because ultimately you're still working toward your goal but everything you're doing is one additional piece to the puzzle to help you achieve that bigger goal right so when I started thinking about my work in that perspective it's like okay what can I learn here that's going to prepare me for the future and that's when I started to get the value out of the role and out of the work and I've adopted that mentality with everything I do yeah no that's actually great because I mean you've got a lot of folks who are sitting in you know some sort of role and they may not be happy with the company the culture whatever and so you you make question like why am I here and then you kind of Disconnect but you know focusing on the bigger picture and thinking through all right well you know what value can I pull from this since I'm going to be here anyway any but you can either complain about it or actually embrace it and just dive in if you're a hiring manager and you appreciate the unique skill sets required to build AI Solutions then I would highly suggest you get your hands on our AI Talent salary guide as you know one of the greatest challenges in building AI products is acquiring the right team over 100 plus

efficiently once you explore our AI Talent acquisition strategies you'll never look at hiring the same way again links are in the description so so getting back to this question of what makes a good business or is this a good business I want to talk about your experience as an LP right sitting on the limited partner side and now you're thinking through how do I make investments into and you can tell me more where those dollars went to whether it be Venture private Equity hedge funds but would just kind of love to learn more about that experience because I think it is a side of the world we don't really necessarily get to dig into too much yeah you know and that was sort of an eyee opening thing for me but again going into that role it was about the Frameworks it was just a different one one level up versus sort of into the weeds I actually felt like it was a harder job for me and you would think it's not because it's less details but I wouldn't say it's less details it's just different details the decision is harder because the decision is that much more concentrated and once you make the decision there's absolutely nothing you can do about that decision thereafter and what I mean by that is this when you invest in a company it's likely that company is going to raise additional capital and as a VC your job the value ad is helping them with different things operationally such that if they need to tweak something or modify go to market strategy or add a different team member you can sort of help with that and if they need additional Capital you can say oh well we're not going to reinvest or we are right but when you invest in a venture capital fund it's a totally different type of analysis you want to meet the entire team you want to talk to the L portfolio companies you do reference checks with other people in the market there's so much stuff that goes into it and often the diligence takes longer because once you make that decision you're committed to fulfill whatever amount you said you were going to invest you got to fulfill that commitment over a usually three to five year period but you're locked in for until that fund terminates so going there for me I understood how funds operated but one of the things I loved and learned and sort of pulled from the experience was how do institutional investors make decisions and how do they analyze fund managers to who are the institutional investors in in the world that are doing this I got to meet a ton of those people and then also being on the front end of all the technology that was developed so for example as a VC you have to focus in a very specific specific vertical in order to be effective and help entrepreneurs with things that they need for us at sarak ventures fintech B2B SAS and like Commerce enablement Solutions but when you're investing in a fund they're also investing in a variety of different categories of technology so one of the fun things that I experienced at these annual meetings that I would go to is talking to all these different types of Founders building all these different types of Technologies it's always felt like was at the Forefront of so much technological advancement and you got to see it all it was that that was really fun in fact I miss going to some of those annual meetings to see how they did it and then hearing the perspectives of so many different Venture capitalists like really smart people who were running and leading these firms and you could get inside their minds of like the how they did what they did versus now you can do that but VCS are a bit more guarded when they're talking to other VCS than when they're talking to someone that could potentially invest in them so I think having that perspective has helped and also just visibility on so many different types of presentation decks and so many different nuances of if you're raising Capital who you should talk to and who you shouldn't talk to it has helped inform what I'm doing now at Sak Ventures but I think it made me a better fund manager because you learn at a very detailed level what it takes to actually operate and grow an Institutional level Venture Capital fund right right and and one thing I would love to get your perspective on is you mentioned who you should actually be talking to as someone who is raising a fund right so someone who has no experience actually going out and raising a fund you may just think whoever can write a check but like the world the universe of check writers can varies from Sovereign wealth funds to high net worth in individuals to um Pension funds and they all have different their own different criteria you know kind of how are there any things that you took away or that you could share that would be particularly helpful for folks who aren't as well versed in going out in fundraising if they're raising a fund right okay I'm about to I'm about to drop some gems on right now it's about to get real okay so let's just start with say foundations or endowments all right a foundation or endowment if they're a billion dollars or less they're going to work with an investment consultant like a Cambridge Associates or stepstone and I'm not dropping names because I know people there just giving you an example right well then you say okay so you reach out to the Chief investment officer at an endowment thinking that they're going to meet with you and they're going to look at your fund stuff no that's not going to that's not how it works the chief investment officer at an endowment or Foundation they Define the investment strategy but they rely on their investment consultant to actually Implement that strategy and vet opportunities for them most of the time investment Consultants have full discretion over how they're investing on behalf of their clients sometimes they don't now the challenging part with investment Consultants is they do everything on a platform so you have to get approved to be an approved manager on their platform and then once you're on that approved list as they bring on more clients that are looking for specific types of mandates whether it's early stage or private Equity or whatever it might be then they'll go to their list and say okay we're going to talk to this manager if you're not on that list good luck and getting on that list can take a long time and not only that staying on the list can be challenging as well because there's always new opportunities that are coming up so that's the one thing and I think many people beat their heads talking to either found foundations and theams that are too small or trying to if they get a meeting with an investment consultant they think that they're in I'm like no you're not and you got to get on the list and that's the hard part now for foundations and endowments that are greater than a billion they might have their own investment team internally and those are better because they don't have to use an investment consultant to make a decision so in those cases you're either going to reach out to the head of research director of Investments sometimes it's the CFO but in most cases it's never the chief investment officer a lot of people try to reach out to cios I'm like no they're so busy they don't have time to meet with a single manager they have a team of people that does that for them they're like a CEO of a company their goal their objective is to direct the strategy of the portfolio not necessarily to make individual Investments even though they can't they still have time to do it so that's Foundation endowments and investment cons Consultants so then you have sort of the next rung below that Pension funds right now as you know dar's Pension funds are huge right they also use investment Consultants but they're often so big if you're raising a small fund like mine it's just not even worth talking to them because their allocation amounts can be so large right most what would you consider small in the world of VC so a pension fund or endowment probably sub 100 million sub $100 million fund okay yeah definitely and that that's considered small to them maybe some of them are maybe 50 million but I would say for the most part sub 100 million is is too small they also have concentration limits as you know meaning that even if they do love your fund they cannot be more than 20% some cases 25% of your total fund size so that's another and then you have family offices which are great the challenge with family offices are is they're very difficult to identify to find who they are because they don't have like oh so and so family office some of them do but for the most part it's like llc's or corporations or it's just a company that the family owns and they just happen to invest on the side but they don't advertise they're not as formal as a investment consultant or traditional investment shop is now for the ones that are a little bit bigger here's what happens they'll hire a small team to help manage their portfolio that team might advertise and usually if their Investment Portfolio is successful they'll start trying to implement their investment strategy for other families that they know then they become a multif family office and it's the same sort of position they'll hire like a head of research they'll hire a CIO these are the people like the head of research like I I always look for that person because they're the Frontline person to determine whether or not your fund or fits their strategy so those that's who you go after not sometimes if they have principles or Associates maybe but that's usually not the case so that's endowments foundations and family offices and then the last one if you're raising a fund High net worth individuals the challenge with them is you really have to have a personal relationship with them many times they're investing in you and then your strategy so if people are fundraising in this sort of manner I always think about it from that perspective like concentric circles you have your high netw Works family offices endowments and Foundations and then at the end is the Pension funds that really big ones when I at my last role at the fund of funds we could invest across the Spectrum we were typically on that outer shell of the concentric Circle because we were large enough to work with pensions endowments and Foundations and then the high net wors were too small even if they wanted to invest but the one caveat with high net worths and I love High net worth I have several in my fund is that if they're not accustomed to investing in funds in general let alone Venture Capital funds they de they generally don't have the Firepower to support you over the course of three funds which is usually when you're going to see the performance start to show in that third fund interesting but the high wor they'll say oh you're raising Capital again it's been three years and I'm not seeing any returns then they're like I'm not going to invest anymore so then you have this hole in your fund rise that you have to fill when certainly you're glad they invested the first time but to have to replace investors it just makes it harder over time but you got to do what you gotta are there things that someone who's raising a first fund should consider compared to someone who may be on that second or third fund certainly that you know the good thing about raising a fund is you can have up to 100 100 investors in your fund and as a GP you have to be one of those investors so really you have 99 investors and I would say if you're if you have a certain fundrais Target you can either a I'd like to do something Charles Hudson suggested he creates this pyramid and at the base of the pyramid that's sort of like your bread and butter maybe smaller investors and that middle part and top part of the pyramid are your larger investors so when you segment that out you can sort of look at your network and look at how you're going to reach that end goal and start sort of blocking this off so when people ask you what's your minimum you say you can segment it well for individual investors it's this amount for family offices and others it's this amount and for larger investors it's this amount and when you do that it makes you look better better as a investment professional such that you're segmenting your strategy and it gives people like a menu of options to choose from and and makes you look more professional yeah so I definitely recommend and one other thing that I wanted to ask before we move on to sharak V you know thoughts on if you're raising your first fund thoughts on Fun Size right because you got you know folks who may want to come out and say hey let me raise a $200 million fund and we're going to vest like you know XYZ anything things that you have learned being on the lp side now GP around kind of first fun how folks should think about size as it relates to kind of probability of actually closing so there's two parts of this one if you have a track record and you know what you're doing and the Market's in your favor whatever you have a good probability of closing however if you say I'm going to raise a 200 million first time fund to invest in preed companies the size of your fund doesn't align with your investment strategy so for example at Sak we're investing in seed stage companies targeting a $30 million fundraise okay well the average seed Stage Company is Raising say $3 million kind of what we averaged but it's not that's the average and the valuations are X so if we're looking for a certain ownership and certain fund or fund raise amount then with a $30 million fund we can fill out a good number of portfolios to take advantage of the power law in what I mean by the power law as you know Darius is you want to have enough companies in the portfolio such that a few of them will drive the returns because the majority of them won't so in defining your fund size and your fund raise approach your fund size sort of defines a strategy but if someone like yourself who worked in private investment banking and you have all these connections and you're trying to invest in later stage companies maybe a 200 or $500 million first fund size makes sense because those initial checks that you're writing are 30 or $40 million MH I would think about it more systematically like that or if you're looking at REI companies and you're just trying to get started maybe your fund size is sub $10 million the fund size is not the issue is have you carefully thought about your strategy such that your fund size makes sense yeah I think what I've seen is the ambition to raise a huge fund off the top part of it because hey you want to get management fees to be able to you know hire folks to actually help out and then there are other reasons as well but there's also hey you could go raise a 20 million fund deploy capital and then go raise the next fund larger fund after you've proven an ability to kind of to execute um and so it doesn't have to be that you go for the Home Run uh right away you could build up to that yeah you know the fund size too as a GP most GP commit 1% to their fund so for that first fund when your management company has effectively if unless you just have money you have to figure out how you're going to pay that 1% for each investment that you make now there are ways that you can do that by GP notes and all those different things and should I explain what GP notes are do yeah yeah yeah that would be helpful I don't think most folks would would know about that so most people if they're raising say a $300 million fund don't have 1% of that just sitting around in a bank account so what they'll do is they will take out a note from the management company against what they owe in their GP commit and the that note will ACR interest over time but as the fund starts to make distributions back to LPS which technically as a GP you are an LP in the fund those distributions go toward paying down the note that you owe so you're effectively just sort of borrowing from the fund but relinquishing your distributions until that note is paid back and that's how people afford to do it because otherwise it's a he it's a big ass yeah absolutely okay great so I want to transition here and talk more about Sak Ventures lost Sak Ventures I think you just mentioned $30 million Target how do you think about we talked earlier about defining criteria for the types of companies that you want to invest in and so maybe an easy way to ask this question is if I'm a Founder how do I know what's the criteria and how do I know if I fit into sarra Ventures criteria so I try to think about criteria by way of alignment with what me and my team can actually deliver so I love Financial technology companies financial services companies because I worked in that sector for such a long time when we're talking about the nuances of how people navigate Building Solutions within that area I can actually add value there's so much stuff that occurs on a regulatory side on the goto Market side just customer behaviors I get that so that's one of the sectors we look at then I have another person who worked for large Enterprise companies he does a lot in that space and then someone else on the team is really good with B Toc companies so we look at that space as well so to the degree that we can add value we'll look at that from a sector wise if it's health care or Life Sciences I understand that space because I did had exposure to that when I was at i2e but it's not my specialty so I tend to not look at those types of companies or and you know we have a list of companies we won't do so that's the first thing the other thing that we look at is just general screening criteria of must have a finished product got to have cons consecutive months of growth in your Revenue we're currently primarily focusing on us-based companies even though we can invest internationally for right now we're focusing on the US we want to see a unified team ideally a diversely Le team like a minority or women L team that's not a requirement but it's something that we prefer so those are sort of a few of the initial checks and then beyond that as we're selecting and making the actual investment we're looking for deeper things like founder market fit is this the right founder in the right Market at the right time we're looking at is the market large enough such that they have the potential to continually grow into an expanding space business model longevity effectively does this team and the product have the ability to evolve as the market evolves one of the things I don't like are Point solution feature type companies where they're solving for a feature but not necessarily building the pic and shovels that a mult a multitude of companies are going to use such that they limit their growth see a ton of those types of companies and then the last one is I think I may have already talked about it but just product Market fit which are some of the standard things so that's sort of our sort of strategy at Sak Ventures and how we screen and then select but then down the line it's the value ad the value ad for us every company needs help with fundraising they need help with finding Talent they often need help with their goto Market strategy and we have I say perfected that but we provide a lot of Hands-On support in that area and to supplement what we do as a team we built this we call it our Guild it's a network of experts who help some companies with specific problems as they grow and I think that's the value that VCS bring it's not just the capital right and so can you talk a little bit more about the kind of the expert side because I can imagine folks you know whether it's a firsttime founder or they've had exits already right they may want to tap into some level of consultant who can help so functional experts in you said go to market hiring fundraising like how does a Founder actually kind of tap into how do they what does it look like to tap into that I think we are consultants and service providers I never said and I never will say I'm an expert in all of these different business functions that a company has but we should have access to the experts so for example just this morning before this call I was on the phone with a friend of mine who works at a tech company and I was talking to him about data security and data breach is and how Tech Founders should be thinking about that so I was talking to him about the internal mechanics of why this is such a big concern for companies and who are the service providers that help to solve these issues and he's one of the members of this Guild group and I was talking to a fintech company yesterday asking them about this specific problem that I was researching and he validated that yes that that's a problem here's how they should be thinking about this X Y or Z so the thing is in concept as a VC you have to have a network to fill the gaps of things you don't know and that's the because you're not going to know everything I mean that that would be impossible unless say you're focusing on one specific thing 100% of the time but most of the time Founders have a variet of different challenges that they're facing all the time yeah uh I want to get your perspective on the market as a whole so you know 2021 was a great year for folks who are raising but really quickly as we moved into 2022 kind of the funding Market dried up you know do you have any 2023 was rough and I imagine if you're any type of founder outside of maybe artificial intelligence right still uh a little bit Rocky here but want to get your thoughts on you know 2024 do you think that that uh we start to see more investment in the market I think that the transition to a better Market won't occur until the end of this year and into 2025 I hate to say that because everyone thought it was going to be like oh 2024 is going to be a great year yeah and it's still like I don't know but just looking at Trends in the data we had like the lowest fundraising for VC in general the lowest number of IPOs in general across like the last five or six seven years and the downstream effect is when institutional investors aren't receiving distributions they're not in most cases allocating to new managers and they're barely able to reup to existing fund managers so then what does that do that causes the VCS me and others to pause on making a tremendous amount of new Investments or deploying as quickly focusing on supporting existing companies so then new companies coming up the pipe they're left trying to figure out how do I get Capital to goow my business in the latest pitchbook report from q1 there were 55 companies raising money right now the capital to supply the capital to demand ratio was like one to two meaning that for every dollar that is out there there were like two or three people asking for it and they had a little note in there saying something to the effect of are there too many Founders in the market right now like maybe there are I don't know but everyone's sort of feeling the pullback of what's Happening Upstream in that when these larger pools of capital aren't receiving distributions it affects the whole line and it's just a cycle that we're in the last one occurred back in 2007 to 2000 then it was like a big boom but we're living in this era where we're coming out of this zerp era zero interest rate policy where Capital was just flowing freely and now that's not happening anymore IPOs aren't as frequent as they were anymore but couple that with what was already happening in that companies that maybe should IPO are staying private so much longer so there's all this like conflation of all these different things happening so I get it you know it's tough for fundraising it's tough for managers like me who are like starting out in in the market yeah but I understand it's just a cycle and once that cycle ends it'll be better I'm not saying it's going to be great but it'll be better and it'll be different what the climate like for specifically thinking about managers right like when you raise the fund you make this commitment hey we're going to deploy we're gonna you know deploy Capital within x amount of years right and then we're going to spend the rest of the time harvesting but you know you hit this moment where it's like okay well let's focus on our existing companies versus new Investments right is there pressure for GPS to deploy so that there isn't sold much dry powder I'm curious what the thoughts are there related to kind of dry powder but we also need to we also need to make you know the right bets there were I think there's about over $300 billion dollar of dry powder just sitting on the sidelines now going layer deeper the majority of that capital is resting with mega funds 500 million or more so it's skewed significantly to one side of the curve and that leaves a lot of the rest of the managers sort of thinking all right people think there's a lot of money out there but where that capital is needed the most it's not there I do think that this time that we're experiencing is forcing VC's back to fundamentals yeah of not investing in HP not investing quickly and not investing just because they have money to invest and more so taking their time encouraging portfolio companies to reduce their burn Etc and then also getting back to the philosophy our job is to return Capital to our investors within a 10-year time frame and maybe that goes to 12 years because of our extensions that we can put onto the fund you see the growth of the secondary funds coming to Market who are sort of taking full advantage of this opportunity to scoop up these later stage opportunities that are just getting long in the tooth because they've been sort of stagnating in these grow stage portfolios for so long and they won't go public so that's become uh a valuable exit strategy for some of these larger funds to provide liquidity to their investors but people thinking and Mark suster was just talking about this yesterday how IPOs shouldn't be relied upon for the liquidity that you need it's private Equity it's these secondary funds and VCS need to start thinking about this as a strategy to say look it's good to maybe you can get a five or 10x return on a company if you sell to a secondary or a private Equity maybe not that much maybe 3 to 5x but if you do that within a seven eight or nine year time frame that's better than waiting on like a 20x return the next 15 years which a lot of the funds will just keep extending yeah so I think that there's all that stuff happening right now and it's important as a fund manager just to be aware of that but I learned from my LP days that this is nothing new they should have been doing this already so it's kind of frustrating hear that oh this is a return like no this is what VC VC should be doing yeah which is interesting I know in my PE days we would specifically avoid we would call them kind of VC deals where the valuation was so high that as a PE firm probably not going to make the acquisition just because what we would have to pay is just Way Beyond any multiple that as a PE firm right but we're actually going to pay and so the VC because of how they structured the their initial investment now has tasked to rely on the IPO because maybe they were investing in hype right versus you know focusing on the fundamental as you mentioned yeah yeah I mean I don't think any sector is immune from when valuations get out of control I do feel like private Equity really did really well over the last 10 years because I don't think they ever really focused just on valuations and they to to maybe to the to their credit or to make things I would say easier they have a little bit more to evaluate whenever they're making an investment and they make fewer Investments so yeah I don't know if it's fair to compare the to but they're very similar yeah interesting so so I know we we're coming up on time here I do want to leave a bit of time you know we kind of crossed the cross the q1 Mark we're in Q2 now as of the recording but anything interesting coming up that you would like to announce for Sak Ventures whether that be you know something that LPS would would like to know Founders would like to know folks who want to become a a a investor at Sak Ventures but I want to open the floor for you you know I feel like when you're considering a investing in a new firm like mine I'm an experienced investor this is my first fund the first year of building an organization is the hardest especially in one of the toughest years in the industry arguably the toughest but but most of that building is done so we have hired a team we've made Investments our infrastructure we've had a first close we brought in a really important anchor investor so when it comes to like drisking a firm like ours that work has been done and now we're sort of hitting our full stride with settling into our investment strategy expanding the book all those different things so if investors are interested in talking to us happy to take that call also think maybe two Founders out there Founders out there as well happy to have those calls as well you know we every single Monday we go through every single founder that has applied to Sak Ventures and we respond to every single one of them it's either a pass it's a company we want to watch or it's a company we want to meet with and we think it's just our job to serve people and give them the courtesy of a response instead of them feeling like things get put into a black hole and maybe the last thing I'll say is if you're going to do something do it big and do it with purpose and that was the biggest reason why I wanted to start SCT Ventures as a minority investor especially in VC which I consider probably the least diverse industry that's out there we are an Open Door meaning that we've had doors shut on us primarily because of just where we were what we look like where we went to school whatever and I want Sak Ventures to be an organization that has an open door policy you know no matter what your ethnicity is or where you went to school where you live we are a firm that will give you the opportunity to make your case and I feel like that's important purpose that I've been called to with this organization and despite how challenging it is that motivates me every day to keep going yeah that that's awesome I love when when GPS can actually get in and talk about the firm because it it makes it makes Venture Capital more personal right Founders get to really understand that look you know kind of you guys are running the the same race in a lot of ways so uh but awesome Kevin I appreciate you taking some time out to share as much as you have with us and definitely you know best luck and we're going to make sure we stay in touch keep up with your progress perfect thank you so much for having me enjoy absolutely",

with another episode we are down in the heart of downtown Oklahoma City today giv me a great pleasure to introduce Our Guest Mr Kevin Moore from sarak Ventures and shout out to Andre calwell for inviting us to positive tomorrow's lunch that we met at a couple weeks ago indeed yes right how good was that phenomenal that organization amazing oh yeah amazing organization so good um yeah shout out to Andre for that and connecting us and then oh he's on the board right I think that's why we had a a table with him the one and only how do you know Andre my sister-in-law went to law school with him okay and we connected years ago lost touch and then recently got back together I'm not even actually sure I think it may have been through positive tomorrows for sure you know what it was through positive tomorrows cuz I've been a donor there for years and someone said oh you should meet Andre he's on the board there and a friend of mine Todd at I forgot his last name he runs a financial investment firm as well he was like oh yeah you should meet Andre I meet him here at uh Bradford house all the time and sure enough ironically Andre walks in the door and I said we were just talking about you so yeah we've been we've known each other for a while I didn't know that the Bradford House was just was one of Andre Spots I'm going to have to ask him about that it must be the pastries not at all cuz I know that he doesn't eat any of that stuff cuz he tries to keep his Fitness he's like a iron freaking athlete and he's going to hate me saying this but I think he had leg surgery last year like a knee surgery or something and he PR his deadlift the day before he went into or the day off he went into surgery because he's like why not I'm going to have surgery anyway might as well just go for it killer I love it um yeah thank you Andre for connecting us appreciate it uh people listening haven't heard Andre's episode he's been on the podcast before I'll link that one below it's a great story um and I made myself like a total fool in that cuz I thought that his Instagram said Coldwell dnasty and it actually says Coldwell Dynasty and my dyslexic brain was like what's the D nasty thing about as on a pug ass you're such an idiot um anyway some people would like that some people would like that right um but yes uh great dude and I appreciate him hooking us up um so we met positive tomorrows had a great lunch on giving Tuesday fantastic organization people listening should definitely go check that out uh you mentioned you donated to that positive tomorrows what leads you to donate to positive tomorrows over all of the other amazing Charities that we have in Oklahoma City and around the nation I think I said this to Andre it took me a while to to Really reconcile this with myself but that organization is so powerful to me because I literally was one of those kids not that I was in positive tomorrows I grew up in Tulsa Oklahoma but the stories that they have of the struggle the the issues with the parents the insecurity of just life like a lot of my childhood was like that so of course as I'm older um in a different position I want to give back and seeing those kids is like sort of heartwrenching for me because I know what it's like to go through those situations obviously Things Are are different for me now and people like Andre yourself and others see that these kids need help so positive tomorrow is doing amazing work amazing work and that doesn't mean other organizations aren't but when you see yourself in other people in a real material way you want to do something so that's my small contribution yeah uh take me to Tulsa growing up then what's that like brothers and sisters big small family parents uh married when they were young and it was my brother and myself initially we lived in a normal life you know we went to school every day my mother stayed at home very traditional my father was really conservative and probably around year four or five when I was age four or five they ended up getting divorced and that was the starting point of all these different changes in our lives we end up Liv living with my father my mother moved out and you know we saw her from time to time and my dad I think took it really hard he unfortunately lost his job ironically at the same time you know how these things happens like one bad thing happens and everything else happens after that we lost our house we were homeless for a couple years and sleeping on the floor living in this small little shed in the backyard of a neighbor's house for years and I remember getting up walking to school and sometimes my friends would say hey let's go over to your house and play and I'm like well I don't really have a house but you know those were tough times very something that I think my brother and myself remember vividly and then from there we went into living in like low-income housing and things were just tough so I think that the part of me that said I was better than my situation started to come out when I was in the eighth grade I gotten in trouble in class I was talking back to the teacher or something and then I just heard this voice in my head that said Hey Kevin you're better than that so I started working hard put my head down went to work in school and started getting straight A all through High School in the 10th grade my high school counselor came to me and he said Kevin I see you're working hard we're getting a lot of inbound scholarships that come to the school and anytime there's one I want you to apply for it so I did and I just applied for so many scholarships sometimes I'd be the only person who applied at all and fortunately thank God I was able to get enough scholarships to pay for like the majority of my college which for me to even go was like such a big deal throughout this period from a youth to graduating high school actually even graduating college you know things were still turbulent my father was incarcerated a number of times my brother ended up dropping out of uh high school and you just kind of looked back and said you know what I'm just so thankful to not be in that situation so when I graduated college uh we moved out of Oklahoma when I say we I met my wife the first year that I had transer referred in to Oklahoma State University and her life was just so different than mine and I admired that her parents had been married like 30 something years and stable home so we just sort of connected not just because of that but for a lot of different reasons but I always tell her like I really admire your family and the values and things like that so we moved out of state lived in Chicago for several years and I was there working as an engineer I got my degree in Structural Engineering I remember sitting at my desk I 6 months into to my job and I said I remember looking down thinking like is this really what I want to do for the rest of my life I had got interested in finance my last year in college started going to the library at night reading books about personal finance investing and thinking oh you can make money doing this and this is what smart people do I grew up relatively poor relative to everyone else I thought I I wanted to change that about my future so thinking through all those different things I went and I said you know what could I do to get into the financial services industry and I started exploring private Equity venture capital investment banking Financial advising and it seemed like the path of lease resistance was to become a financial adviser so I remember thinking I called my mother and we had reconciled by that point and I said hey I'm thinking about quitting my job as an engineer where I'm making pretty good money to do this uh Financial advising thing she said well how much is the pay and I said well it's 100% commission and she was like well if you don't try then you'll if you it's better to try and to fail than to not try at all so I took that and just ran with it and quit my job after just under two years went to work and started building up a financial services practice mind you I'm in Chicago I don't know anyone up there so I had to just hit the ground like hustling hard working 15 16 hours a day I remember walking around in the streets of Chicago so much that the shoes the leather shoes that I was wearing literally had holes in the bottom of them and at the end of every day lit literally at the end of every day my feet would be soaked and my shoes would just have salt all over them and I did my best to cover it up but I just remember one morning I was in the office literally in the office sitting at my desk at 5:30 in the morning thinking like why am I doing this and that feeling of oh I don't want to fail I'd lived around failure so much I saw so much fa failure I experienced so much lack that I didn't want my future children to have to go through that so that's what drove me and I felt like I was also making a difference in the lives of other people by introducing them to all these different things that I hadn't really experienced as a as an as a youth and was uh currently experiencing as an adult at that time so I did well you know it was hustle and grind every single day and accomplished a lot in Chicago we had our first child in Chicago my son Isaac uh we bought our first house in Chicago had a great church and things up there and then ultimately my wife decided that uh she wanted to move back to Oklahoma and I was resistant to that for a lot of reasons I felt like Chicago was a new beginning for me as a person and our family and I didn't want to be near any of those different things that being said that doesn't mean I was bitter or angry with anyone I'm not a person who holds on to anger or any sort of resentment toward anyone Life's too short for that so we eventually went back and I had to start over we had to start over didn't know anyone in Oklahoma City I'm originally from Tulsa and and when we got here I went into that same type of work but ultimately said you know I want to get closer to the companies that I'm investing in and thoughted started exploring venture capital and I thought oh I'm in Oklahoma how am I going to do that there's no Venture Capital industry here mind you this was in 2010 so I had to start over building the network just grinding it out every single day burning through our cash and not knowing how we were going to make it but when you've been through something hard before it's like okay you can do that again I remember when we came back we rented a house or like a duplex in Norman I'm sorry in um Edmund and things were tough but you know it was different like we were adults I remember getting to a point where we literally had like 0. in the bank and thinking like oh man I have a son I have a wife like how are we going to do this but you know what someone said I think I saw this in a movie it's like when you're stuck between a rock and a hard place what is the solution well the solution is you just go deeper so my mentality was I'm just going to like keep working hard and from that again place so of rock bottom if you will uh you just you ascend out of it kind of like what we were talking about when I first came in here is like the moments where you feel like you've lost when you're like grinding and hustling you appreciate the win so much more so that's what we did and for the first 2 years we just rebuilt and eventually everything was just on an upward tick and I was resentful coming back to Oklahoma at first but so glad we did it's so amazing to be back around family it's so awesome to be experiencing all of the things that were put in place sort of decades ago and to reap the benefits of of how Oklahoma City is changing everything that we wanted to achieve in life we've been able to do in Oklahoma and including family personal financial starting my own firm and having the experience of working in venture capital and traveling the world I just think it's like a God thing to have the you know feeling like you can do all those different things if you just sort of let go and let things happen so that's where I'm at now you know we're in a living our dream life and I can't be more thankful for it yeah congrats man it's awesome um I want to unpack a few things uh going back and when you're in school and you have that moment you hear that voice you mentioned kind of church is is was part of your life as well did it feel like a god voice were you kind of up until that point in church a lot uh you said dad was pretty conservative but sounds like you know your your brother and dad took a different path to what you did and that was kind of a pivotal moment for you where does that voice come from and that awareness at that young age to be like oh no from this this moment I'm going to get straight A I'm going to get my head down because your situation could have gone you know you could it would have been easier of you to go the other way statistically yeah I shouldn't be here but my faith is really important to me I think that everyone is entitled to their own belief mine is you know I'm a Christian I'm I'm I'm a a person of faith and I almost think you have to be able to hold on to something bigger in order to get through certain types of things and I tell people that claim they have no faith like everyone has faith in something so I think that those moments of clarity for me always come in moments of silence and great pressure and and stress so that's usually those sort of Tipping Point moments when I hear that whisper if you will like you're better than that or you should do this or you should do that and a lot of people just have to make the choice on whether or not they want to listen to it so for me listening in the big moments in the right moments you don't always understand how it's going to turn out but I had attribute 100% of where I'm at to one my faith and then two the opportunity to be in a position to actually do it and that is um I think something that's changed my life I think about this too you know we've as adults we have um experienced loss friends and family over the years and literally just this morning I was writing down uh in my journal about I'm 44 years old in the middle of my life and I know that life is not certain and you start to think about that when you experience loss how do I want to impact the world that to me is really what matters and I think that starting Sak Ventures has been my way of doing that the goal for what we're doing is democratizing access to venture capital for people who have traditionally lacked access to this space so we're looking to back people from all backgrounds and all geographies across the United States and when I think about my journey I am the last person that someone would have said you'd be running your own Venture Capital firm one day but I think that if you're a person of faith and grit and just raw tenacity you can pretty much do whatever you want to do in this country and I think that being in Oklahoma like and I'm not just saying this cuz this is Oklahoma podcast being in places like Oklahoma where you effectively have a Launchpad to do whatever you you want if you work hard and you can do all the things and have a good life I think our experience in Chicago I was working really really hard and I think that uh we were you know we did okay up there but had I been doing that same effort here we would have been way further down the line it's just a different environment I also think that the culture of people is different too where in a larger place places it can be somewhat transactional less Community F whereas Oklahoma City despite its rapid growth still holds on to a lot of that and I'm not sure if that's true for other places in Oklahoma I've only lived in Tulsa and in Oklahoma City but I think it's just about sort of the culture I forgot what your question was but um no you the other thing I I kind of and I agree with you the community side you know and it's something that you know I've only lived kind of pure when I've been in the States but kind of relating it to back home I I kind of feel the same way about Community relationship business and and kind of growth as well there's a there is a growth mindset here but it's it's a we growth mindset right not an ie and me growth mindset um which is you know makes great for fostering business relationships and Partnerships and general growth going back to you being getting the scholarships applying for scholarships what's the what's the reason that you choose to go into mechanical engineering when you're a kid I thought it would be the best way to satisfy my curiosity okay I was always curious about how things worked I think I had that being the benefit of like the younger child sitting back and just watching what was happening before me and whether that was like something experiential like with a person or watching what someone else was doing or building I don't know that's a good question I always think like why do people choose what they do but I think it for me I attribute it to just curiosity of trying to figure out better ways of doing things based upon the things that I saw not being done correctly so that extended into wanting to be creative like I was a phenomenal artist when I was a kid I always say all the way up through college and I thought art was a great exper expression of things in your mind I've always been fascinated with bringing things out of your mind and making them material I think it's one of the unique things that we have and possess as human beings is our ability to be creative so art was a way of doing that and I thought oh I like drawing maybe I should be an architect and then architecture came into well how do they actually make these amazing things and that led to engineering so engineering is fantastic because it's less about the building and it's more about process process is like how do you do things and how do you solve problems and literally as a kid when you grow up with out a lot of things you have to figure out how to do stuff whether that's feed yourself or make something work that you need that's broken you just kind of have to figure that out you learn how to be resourceful when you don't have a a lot of stuff which carries over into well it's what Engineers do so I did that and it was a great short career but has been beneficial in so many different ways in every single thing that I've done you're pretty good at math and art then right it's problem solving generally what leads you to pick up a pencil when you're a kid drawing artwork and and I mean what style and and fascination with art do you dive into no my father was a really good artist he could draw with pencil medium pencil like really well and had phenomenal it has phenomenal penmanship so I always used to challenge myself to just write as perfectly as I could whether it was print or cursive I still have very good penmanship and that was sort of the beginning I take I think that and I always tell this to younger people the product that you produce will be consumed by somebody and how do you want to represent yourself like if someone were to pick up something that I wrote and like oh Kevin Moore wrote that that leave behind or whatever he wrote is an expression of who you are and if your penmanship is sloppy and you don't care to me that's a translation of well is that the type of person that that that is that I believe like if I to invent a religion I tell this everybody if I had to invent my own religion it' be called incrementalism okay and incrementalism is this belief that every little thing you do compounds over time and if you want to make progress towards something big you have to believe in doing a little bit of that thing every single day consistently so managing those little details are so important to me and if I'm like that then the way that I write should be a translation of that belief so if every single stroke of my pen or pencil is is an expression of something I believe then of course my pmip is going to look good so you know I taught myself how to speak Spanish I've never lived in a Spanish speaking country but it's always been a goal of mine to learn another language so when I graduated from UCL with my MBA I said I'm going to finally do this I started learning Spanish and people say oh what's the secret like there is no secret you just have to do three things every single day speak it write it read it or listen to it I guess four things and I did that every day it's like well how much time are you taking like 5 minutes then that five turned into 10 then the 15 then to so on and so forth and then 11 years later you can speak fluent Spanish and obviously I've traveled and done a lot of things in between them but there's no secret just like there's no secret to success there's no secret to it you just have to do the little things every single day all the time I think that life is just like that but I attribute it to the incremental little things that you do make up who you are and where you are in life maybe Last Story my mom and I were had a scholarship dinner in Tulsa and the guy on stage was preaching to all the kids and the the the audience who had won this scholarship not preaching like a sermon but just like preaching lessons of life and he said you you he said every one of you has to remember that you and only you are responsible for the outcome of your life like no one else can control the outcome like every sing single decision you make is your decision and the accumulation of those decisions create who you are and where you will be in your station in life I still remember that to this day that was literally over 25 years ago over 25 years ago and I believe in that so the fundamental like the the basis of this religion would be on those principles yeah I mean people listening if that's the only thing you take away from today take that away because write it down put it on your fridge like put it on your you know your you know we're coming to the end of the year there New Year's resolutions it's that time to reflect and and you're right if you just literally 5 minutes 10 minutes every single day we all want to do everyone you know probably says I want to do a different language right or I want to do yoga or I want to be more flexible I want to do this that like it's that simple it's so simple I had this I have this goal that I'm working on right now yeah is I want to be able to do 200 push-ups in just one go so I said how am I going to do that it's a pretty big go right yeah but guess how it started so months ago yeah I said I'm going to start doing five sets of different types of push-ups in a row okay so I do five one two three four five then I move to the different types I do five of five different types of push-ups so hands wide hands close together Pike pushups like now do those in a row say Okay each week I'm going to add one to each set so then the next week instead of doing five for five do six for five so now I went from 25 to 30 so I've been doing that for months now I'm every night doing 10 and what was it 29 * 3 so I'm doing 145 push-ups every day yeah every every day yeah and then on Sunday I change it to go up one okay so next week I'll be at 150 so every week you had one every week I had one every week yeah but you're doing these daily right so adding one every week is like adding five so you're almost 30 weeks in then yeah you're at week 29 right now so the idea is like adding one isn't a big deal right but it's the exponential effect of that you see what I'm saying so then now when I do 150 it's like no big deal but it would have been months ago is that your only workout every day as well no that's just my night routin that's your R that's just my night routine love it that's but you're what literally start with five right five every day or five of each one every day 25 push-ups a day for a week and then you've just gone up incrementally once add one yeah so then 30 weeks in right and so you'll get to your goal when you're what 40 something weeks yeah right 48 pretty simple yeah 45 May something like that but that's how everything starts I said to myself I wanted to start working out every single day so what did I do like I'm going to start 15 minutes all right then that 15 minutes turned into 30 minutes and then so on and so forth then you have this routine but whenever I was working at My First Financial job one of our trainers said in order to be successful you have to prepare your environment for success and that that sort of rang true for me in that if you prepare your environment to succeed you have a higher probability of actually succeeding so every night before I go to sleep I set out my workout clothes I know exactly what I'm doing so in my sort of sleepy Slumber and and stumbling to the closet I don't even have it's just like a routine I just put on this and put on that and go do that like I don't even have to think about it so if you eliminate all those distractions then you can do these things like every night my yoga mat is right there by the bed and so I do the push push-ups and then I do my stretching routines like I'm not even thinking about it it's just a part of the cycle but I think life is like that too whether it's your personal professional Financial whatever it might be people think that you have to do these really big things to do something amazing it's just a compilation of small things every day yeah what are the other goals you're working on at the moment so that's one uh sort of personal is I guess let me talk about Fitness more on that it's get to 200 yeah I want to be able to from a stretching standpoint put my head to my knees I'm getting close a little bit every day so I do that every day um now like Financial not really worried about that stuff cuz you know what is that it's all relative to everybody you know we don't have any debt so that's a big one professional is a big one yeah starting this company was a is a lifelong goal of how do we build the next generation of venture capital firm here in Oklahoma and to me what that looks like is one that is super inclusive has a diverse leadership team is one that is demystifying venture capital and has a very Hands-On approach to working with with companies I knew that in order to to do what I'm doing I said it's going to take 5 years of my life of just straight up grinding it out sacrifice not just for me but for my family as well and that's a big goal for me is getting Sak Ventures to a point where where we can stand alone and have the impact in Oklahoma and throughout the country that we want to have the VC industry literally and I don't know about this like statistically or factually it is the least diverse by ethnicity and gender industry I would say in the world less than 1% of venture capitalists are black people like myself less than 1% I'm not and that's in the US it may be even worse in other places less than 1% of the Venture Capital dollars that are raised every single year go to women and people of color that doesn't mean that there aren't other good companies out there but it's not representative proportionately MH so if we can say one we want to invest in everybody so what that means is will invest in the proportionate amount of everybody and we'll see all of those companies and I think there's more opportunity there there's a lot of data that shows that more diverse things pro they do better so if we can deliver to our investors this idea that not only are we choosing amazing companies that have the opportunity for hyper growth but we're doing so in a manner that uh increas is the opportunity for everyone that's out in the market maybe the last thing I'll say about that is one of the things I learned early in my career is that you find the highest quality product or service or whatever when you have a full view on what all the opportunities actually are so if you don't see all of the opportunities in the market how do you know you're getting the best so with Sak Ventures because we're seeing so many opportunities and we've widened the aperture for the types of Founders that we're just open to talking to We believe that we're significantly increasing the probability of giving investors the best product if you will that's a big goal it's one that motivates and moves me to get up at 4:30 every single day and do this as hard as we're going yeah how I think I already know the answer to this and I think you kind of might have already answered it as well but curious to because it's something I struggle with you know what you said and based on your situation growing up you know there was a level of comfort that you got to right and and there was a level that you know you proved a lot of people wrong by getting to you know mechanical engineer got a good job you know and you have this itch to be like hang on finance senior year I thought about Finance how do you fight that Comfort because a lot of people and I struggle with this too cuz you know I just you know yeah you have a house you have a car you take the box you're a member of the country club or you have kids or whatever whatever those social things that you goals that you get to there comes a point where you get and you're just like why get up at 4:30 I'm like this is good enough yeah like what is in you in your own words I guess that keeps you going and fights that Comfort because I don't I think people probably listening struggle with it too right they just they get to a certain State you know thing they let their health go a little bit they've got some money in the bank now they bought the car that they want to drive like you know they're now they're not continuing to do those five minute things every day to continue they might learn a different language or to push themselves to keep going they get lazy and might get fat and whatever it is like everyone seems to do that at a certain point in their career doesn't sound like you've done that yet I think that one I just want to by disclaimer say that people can do whatever they want to do and there's nothing wrong with that yeah I just want to put that out there that I'm not better than anyone no one's better than anybody at all right but one of the questions I've always wanted to know is what are my limits and I think when you live with this sort of the conditioning of lack and wanting to maybe do better question you ask yourself is like well what is better like am I doing the best that I can do and so when I ask myself that every single day it's like am I giving this my best is this the best I can write if you will I also I'm on this sort of kick of wanting to understand like what is my true limit I said this to my wife I was running one day I think it was in New York or somewhere I can't remember I had run like five miles and I was like feeling amazing and I said you know I've never tested how far I could run just straight up and I said I wonder how far I could run if I just like kept going until I just absolutely passed out and I you know there's a lot of people who do that and if you've read books about people like is it David Goggins or groggin whatever like he's like running a 100 mile marathons in the desert no what whatever but he was just like man I could do more but I think there's this fundamental question that everybody should ask thems is like what is your absolute limit and the reality is as human beings we have no limits and that statement that belief has permeated my mind to be like yeah we do I just want to figure out what mine is and it's like okay how healthy can I eat is there a limit to that how far can I run how much better of a person can I whatever whatever it is how many push-ups can I do if I get to 200 I'm like well can I do 201 one I saw a competition of this guy on YouTube literally I think he did a thousand push-ups in a row his his arms became so functional like our legs like we could go walk for hours and not even feel it in our legs like we wouldn't even think about it you probably go to wherever you're you're from the UK you can go walk around your hometown for hours and not even be like oh you know you're not going to be like I need to rest my legs you're just like even if your legs get tired keep going this guy had done that with his arms I thought that's pretty amazing so I think that that motivation that drive for doing that is just now I'm on this kick maybe midlife crisis CR kick of what are my limits and I don't think I've reached them yet yeah it's I've done a few you know when you turn 30 you do a few things right you start running you start playing golf or whatever you know we all know the cliche things like got into a little bit of running late 20s early 30s and did some kind of races that you know there's a great race shout out to the Midsouth gravel race in in Still Water um there's a on the Friday there's a 50 km run and then on the Saturday the real people show up and ride 100 mile bike right some people do both those guys are crazy um but I've done the run I haven't done the bike yet I've done the run and and you know you're yeah it's 31 Mi 50 km and there's people running that in like 3 and a half hours so crazy crushing life and and I did my time in 525 this year um and took 45 minutes off my previous year's time so I was like I was yeah I crossed the finish line and I'm like I need to sit down right like I'm broke and you know the guy who was at the finish line that kind of watched me finish said to me you know I'm sat in the curb and just kind of like you know panting and can't feel my knees he you see that lady over there and I said yeah some like you know 50-year-old lady or whatever he goes she finished 30 minutes ago you got to point that I appreciate it but you you have to you have to test your limits right like my limit at that time was 525 I'm hoping to do it's in March um and I'm hoping to do it in sub five this year like I'm going to try and keep going but there's so many unanswered questions and we just don't you know okay most people relat to Fitness right what are our limits in Fitness cuz it's easier I think to find our limits in Fitness right um but there's so many other ways to find your limits yeah right AB many other and you know I think part of it too if you have a coach or like your friend saying hey this woman did it in 30 you should do less 30 minutes less yeah she's 20 years older than you but you know like our kids like the Next Generation my wife and our kids if with the same work that I have now I had their situation oh my gosh right I mean come on I'm working within the limitations and the constructs of the limits that were around me yeah and thank God first and to America and to the country and Oklahoma and all these different opportunities that I've been able to do what I'm do here but I'm like I'm I'm I'm trying to do the best with what I have see you also you spent 30 plus years building a foundation so that you can really then use those foundations to Del frog the kids growing up now now they already have that Foundation thanks to you and your wife exactly so I think that the I think the point that I'm trying to make here is that everybody has a different sort of living situation different upbringing situation and one thing my father did say to me that resonates to this day is do the best with what you have and don't complain don't act like anyone owes you anything just don't complain shut your mouth and do your work work I remember the story it's quite an uninteresting one but I was in the kitchen as a kid washing dishes and I ran out of dish soap and my dad said well just get some laundry detergent and I said I don't think that's going to work so he brought it over and he did it and I'm washing the dishes with laundry detergent the powder kind and if you've ever done that it makes the dishes like extremely slippery almost to the point where you can't hold them like sliding out of my hand I was like man this is too hard this is a waste of time and laundry turn that's for clothes it's not for dishes and he said look you got to do the best of what you have it's all we have so make it work and I'll never forget that story but it was the principle of that like if someone I put that on my tombstones do the best of what you have so we all have our constructs of how we grew up and some people like my kids have this amazing opportunity and and so do most kids so that's why I'm like don't complain just do the best yeah where you mentioned ear there's always been a dream for you to launch kind of your own company your own business let's talk about that when did that launch where did the idea come for for for you the inclusion and everything and the opportunity you see and then also where do you find the name for it as well where does that come from I was working in venture capital for probably six or seven years before having the perspective of seeing where the problems were in the industry and it wasn't until I'd spent a lot of time traveling around the country and around the world of saying that man there's just not a lot of people who look like me in this business and deciding then that I wanted to try to build something so I said okay great that was step one step two was sort of coming up with the idea and at my last job we were in San Francisco giving a presentation to our investors about the portfolio and I equated the idea of building a company like climbing a mountain and if you look at Mount Everest there are zones in order to get to the top and the higher zones are more dangerous they require more expertise more sort of guidance so I thought okay I like a mountains I think that you know life is like a mountain when you're trying to get to the top you overcome a lot of you have to go through a lot of different things so I remember one day I was watching a documentary around climbing mountains which I do all the time cuz I I love that and my wife will never permit me to climb like Mount Everest I would like least like to go there that to that point that 14 Peak is it 14 Peak yeah that 14 Peaks phenomenal documentary how in the world did the I mean go watch it people it's amazing please yeah so yeah I've watched all of those but I I was watching one and they were talking about uh K2 and K2 the narrator was like oh these there's a massive Sak on the top of K2 and these climbers have to get through there and yada Y and it just clicked in my head it's like oh this Sak is an enormous obstacle and when you look at this thing it's like a massive wall of ice that's hundreds of feet tall hundreds of feet wide very very precarious and dangerous but the sherpers were able to help them get through there then they got to the summit so I thought man you know Sak Ventures would be a good name for the firm because we all have Saks that we have to overcome in our life I've had them personally professionally everybody has had them what better name to name a firm to say we help Founders overcome the Saks or the obstacles that they face when they're trying to navigate this industry or trying to raise money for their business or trying to overcome operational issues so Sak Ventures is great so I as the name and then someone said to me hey did you know that sarak spelled backwards is cares and I said I had no idea then I looked at it I'm like oh it does say cares I mean we do care I think that's a bit corny and cheesy but we obviously care about the founders we work with but the name sarak is sort of Genesis came from that yeah that's really cool uh what was the when you take yourself back to reading Finance in the library and reading all those books did you think at that moment I want to be in a finance I want to have a financial company was that a moment or was it I mean later on you're just like I want to know Finance because I've never been taught this and it's not something I it was the latter it was more so I just wanted to teach myself how to do this but no I I never thought I always thought at some point I might run my own company but I didn't start Sak Ventures because I want to run my own company solely it was more I wanted to be a part of building something and never thought that it would be Finance I mean it could have just been a a regular company if it hadn't worked out that way I just think that the trajectory of my life was sort of pushing me this way and the medium of Finance was to me a massive Liberator in my life and now having the ability to have a seat at the table to control where it's going venture capital is like the Phenom like the best path for making that happen and I love my work I'm so lucky to get to do this job and I wouldn't trade it for the world yeah when did this company stop January of 23 okay took the first quarter some of Q2 of 23 to just get the infrastructure started and then started talking about the story and building a name for the firm and made a couple hires some part-time some fulltime we had our first close as a fund which when you're raising a pool of capital you say hey we're raising x amount of dollars and then you can bring in new investors in different phases and at a certain point you have to cut it off because it's a it's not a publicly traded fund and we won't cut off our fundraising until sometime late next year but that's sort of the idea when you're investing in private markets you are taking money from private investors pulling it together and then pushing it out to different companies yeah with um do you still read quite a lot today every day okay I have a goal to well not a goal it's just from 5 to 530 every day I read okay something I try to read two books a month a lot of that depends on the the thickness of the book yeah but I've I'm on track for that um and some of these books are big but the idea is like how do you get through a book it's like well page of time one page at a time not no you're not you're thinking too big sentence at a time how no even more weird and letters exactly okay one letter at a time okay so that's how I think about reading it's like oh you know if I read sometimes I calculate I have 15 days I read this book how many pages I have to read per day and you just do that yeah what are you reading right now I'm reading this book called the 100-year marathon it's about the interplay between China and US struggles okay and um phenomenal book I recommend people read it because it really accurately describes the relationship between the US and China and how they've sort of inter wov themselves into our society such that it's very hard to separate from them but there are some power dynamics some good some bad just a great book we and when I say we my friends and I we talk about how people need to read more to understand a lot of the history behind some of these things so that's one book I'm reading the book I just finished was a book called the reverse Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell it's sort of a continuation of his first book which basically talks about tipping points but in this case these are tipping points that are actually bad and why did those happen yeah quite frankly it wasn't as good as his last book but I still read it but I'd like to read a lot do you do any guess speaking I've only been on podcasts but Define guest speaking just in the sense of uh taking you back to that scholarship dinner and having that guy on stage oh no I would love to do more of that okay let me say more I would love to do some of that and let me tell you just 100% transparency with you and your audience it it it took starting Sak Ventures for me to become this transparent because even though I have a track record as an investor Sak Ventures is a new firm so people are investing in me mainly so opening up about my why is really was really hard for me no one I mean look it's embarrassing to talk about how I grew up or used to be it's embarrassing like oh your dad was in prison a number of times or you were poor and you did this and like who talks about that stuff nobody no most people don't want to hear that so I didn't talk about that for years not even with my wife so when she started hearing more of these details and others she's like man you got to tell people that like it's really motivating so then prayerfully and just thinking through it if I don't share that story with people then so many other people won't know and be motivated to overcome their obstacles cuz I think there are a lot of kids who just don't have hope and once you lose hope it's over yeah to that point I listened to a podcast recently talking about um just exactly that really we don't share our stories as much right and it was in the sense of like the older generation doesn't share their stories so when Grandma granddad's uncles aunts are gone like you don't those stories go with them right no one's documenting these stories and so for me one of my goals for next year is to do more documenting it to open the podcast up to um you know interviewing families coming to me to interview their their grandparents and tell the stories time right just kind of that's that's kind of the the next arm to this is Oklahoma is you know there's only so much I can do for the podcast and I yeah I would love to do this every day and post daily episodes but the there is you know when look back at my own life right my own grandparents and my parents like you know thankfully I still have time with my parents with my grandparents I interviewed my granddad I didn't interview my grandmother or my grand um but I interviewed my granddad and it's the greatest thing I've done I think for the family like you know cuz we have that right but you know it's so easy to do with an iPhone just set up right but it's people to your to your point have to you you had to get over that you had to cuz cuz like you said you know and that's you know everybody has a story like yours very few people have a story like yours which makes your story very compelling um you know but we just don't the old generation isn't they're not storytellers they weren't like they they were taught to keep things in keep their head down grind you know put food on the table like they weren't thinking I have a podcast I have this like it's on their radar yeah we live in this Society now where there's like this people Embrace more openness but it might be because it's so much much easier to reach people so people don't really show the authentic side of themselves cuz they like oh why do I need to do that I can move on to the next thing so for me it was and you know I still feel not like super comfortable doing it but I've gotten it's easier to do to realize our stories are about who make us who we are they make us who we are and we shouldn't be ashamed of it we should just embrace it and move on yeah finishing up um I know we we're going to do this again because I love where you're going and and want to do this you know with a catch up in kind of 3 to five years and see where everything's going um 20 there's there's a great guest on the podcast and a guy named Colonel Stanley Evans who plans his life in 20 years St and he's like who am I going to be in 20 years right kind of like what you do you break it down daily you know the whole eatting an one by at a time but it's great to when most people do the three to 5 year thing and the 10 year thing but when you look at 20 years you know you're going to be 64 years old and 20 years looking back as a 64y old what are the things that you want your 64 year old to be proud of and tell you I want people to remember me as a very generous person and that means that one of like my lifelong goals has been to start a scholarship fund for my high school in Tulsa what was your High School East Central High School not a great school I don't think even still it's not a great school but I did the best I could there anyway but to have a scholarship fund to help those kids and to support the athletic program and do Phil Phil philanthropy my wife and I we've always talked about starting our own like family office at some point and investing in young aspiring people so when I'm 20 years from now I want to say I've done those things and that's the Legacy no one's going to remember how much money you had or things you owned but it's really about the impact that you made on the world if we can do that then I think we have lived our fullest life yeah last question because I'm in the real estate world and this will be the only real estate question related to the podcast but I love asking this question if you were to wave the magic wand and build your dream house what's your dream house what does it look like what are the non-negotiables of things you must have in your dream house I can tell you where it would potentially be okay I have recently fallen in love with Central Park so I'd love for it to be on Central Park maybe two or three stories very modern and clean I love like the Danish architecture like very minimalist when I'm in that type of environment my mind is just clear and there's an extreme to this whole limits thing I'm now embarking on this idea of like when I travel how few things can I bring and you just don't real realze how liberating that is people want more and more and more but I would love to design the house around less less and less like Finer Things but fewer brilliant love it mate thanks so much for your time really appreciate

    "title": "The Path from LP to GP with Kevin Moore of Serac Ventures",
    "channel": "Valor Ventures",
    "date": "2024-04-23",
    "transcript": "hey everyone welcome back to the Atlanta startup podcast my name is William Leonard your host for today really excited to be sitting down with uh someone who I've known for some time now and Kevin Moore welcome to the podcast thank you for having me good morning Kevin it's great to have you on um you are now the managing partner and founder at sarak ventures and we are going to dive into all things Sak in this podcast but I really want to jump right in um your background is very interesting you've been in the world of financial services Northwestern Mutual Morgan Stanley the Federal Reserve then you were uh an LP a limited partner um for sometime and now you switched over to the GP the general partner side of things with running sarak I would just love to hear you take us down the path from from LP to GP absolutely thanks for allowing me to come on the show and share a little bit of my story I think that one of the things I love about people in the Venture Capital industry in general is just the versatility and nonlinearity of their backgrounds and I feel like in Venture Capital having multiple experiences allows you to relate and and understand path of so many different entrepreneurs yeah I guess one missing piece before becoming an LP I worked at a firm called i2e where I was investing in startups and it was there where I was Raising capital for one of our funds and called on a fund of funds and didn't realize that this organization was within our state Oklahoma and I went to work there as a partner and that transition of going from the GP side to the lp side was an interesting one and that it was a different framework by way of looking at Investments but I always considered myself an investor and that was one of the things where I said well if you're an investor you should be able to think about investing as a framework and apply that to whatever medium so working on the lp side was enlightening I will tell you that it is something that I think a lot of GPS have not had the experience or chance to do and it's certainly been one that has been additive to the role that I'm in now sort of back in on the GP side and especially in the managing Partners seat so happy to go in any direction there but uh we could dig really deep into this but I want to make sure that that's just sort of the overall benefit I've got from seeing both sides of the table you're right there is a lot of overall benefit there and we will certainly dive into that I would love to get more context on a thesis of Sak right you have started to find that such a unique moment when we think about where Venture is today so when you you know were thinking about starting sarak how did you go about crafting this thesis to fit within the ecosystem what did you see missing in the capital stack and and how did you think about SX differentiation you know all the things you you go through mentally when starting a fund I will say to be honest in hindsight 2023 was the worst time start a venture capital fund obviously I didn't know that at the time uh the idea of starting a firm started around three or four years ago it always been something I'd always wanted to do since graduating college but filling in the knowledge gaps was something that necess that definitely needed to happen and it was probably about halfway during my time as an LP having been able to peer inside the portfolio of so many different fund managers where I started to see there was an opportunity to say one there's not enough representation in the Venture Capital industry for people who look like me as a person of color and then two there were some amazing emerging large categories in the market where amazing Founders were building great Technologies such as in the future of work category the Creator economy category and obviously with companies that are sort of expanding access to financial services so when I started to think about that in regard to a fund uh 2023 was really a year of refining that and then bring I brought on another individual to the team Daryl freder and we were sort of talking about the categories where we were investing and what it is fueling in the economy and this thesis of Entrepreneurship as the fut as the future of work and effectively what that means is we're trying to back companies that are expanding access to Capital products and services that increase and make the lives of individuals and businesses easier more efficient and just overall better and the companies that we've back so far enable that but that's the thesis of the firm going forward and obviously that might change over time but really the whole thesis is expansion of the access to services for the masses and not looking at Venture this narrow gap of it only helps a certain type of person and and can only go into certain types of markets so we have that versatility at SRA Ventures future of work expansion and or democratization of services for the mass is a really interesting place to be at right now as we think about you know one place I think about that being hyper relevant is sort of the alternative investment space you've got so many platforms now that are popping up allowing consumers to invest um in alternative asset classes like wine or real estate or whatever it may be um when you think about the traditional kind of stock market and how people are were in that during the pandemic and now they're transitioning into to unique things gold um stocks or whatever it may be so as you kind of think about that what you know what what part of the capital stack relative to venture are you focused on is it seed is it preed series a any geography bounds um tell us more about that Peter Wagner at Wing Adventures years ago did a study called the I forgot what I think called a cannonball effect or something like that effectively what it was was a research study on how companies have been able to do more with less at earlier stages in their life cycle and when he compared series a stage companies 10 years ago they were at the same valuation and had made the same type of progress as a seed Stage Company today and that really reinforced Sak's thesis to say hey you know what we can come in at the seed stage add a lot of value get respectable valuations and not have like these crazy enormous uh ground sizes and still be able to make an impact because these companies have progressed so much further along by way of what they can do with technology their ability to work virtually and have super talented people on their team all around world the proliferation and ease of advertising and getting their products out the market there's just been like a huge paradigm shift in how companies can come to Market and can do so so much faster so that sort of uh galvanized okay seed and then even now looking at preceeds companies that have made significant progress to where now you can look at it like a late preed Stage Company is one where they're at the brink of being a seed Stage Company but it's might they might be classified as preed just because of their round size or because of their valuation but it it says nothing to the fundamentals of the company one of the things that I like to look at in a company is their Pipeline and where they're going and getting into a company early you can get a sense for how they're doing that how they're taking how they're going to Market who their potential customers are which is something that we try to do is talk to their potential customer customers to get a sense of is this a company that's poised for hyper growth so the the the semantics around is it preed is it seed there's a framework of valuation round siiz pipeline that we look at to determine okay this is the company that we want to back uh if it's beyond that and it's a series a or series b or later generally the round sizes are too big for us but the seed late preed stages are where I think we can be the most effective and add the most value I agree with that and you mentioned right I think preed seed pretty much have a different definition depending on what region of the country and world that you're in as well certainly a preed in the bay may be different from a preed in Oklahoma or Atlanta or Miami um and you're right it's about developing a framework as a fund and as a team and you also mentioned how there's a different sort of speed and efficiency to market today that are enabling companies to be a little bit more mature than they would be let's say 10 15 20 years ago and I think that's definitely attributed to this paradigm shift that you mentioned also this platform shift of now having AI at the table to build applications and and do the role of you know several team members with a team of three and so I'm curious to hear you know at sarak you and Daryl and the broader team how are you all thinking about AI in terms of specific verticals that you're interested in whether it be along the future of work or unique ways that you want to or are thinking about deploying AI internally at Sak I love AI I love technology when it and what I mean by that is I love how certain Technologies can make existing processes and workflows and even data collection and automation easier better and faster now ai to me having been around investing for the last 18 years not and again that's not all in the private markets eight years of that was in the public markets but what I think about is not so much the technology but I think about the utility and to me utility is so much more important than anything regarding technology and I've seen of several companies over the years and even other sectors over the years that have fallen because people were so en enamored with the technology that they weren't thinking about okay what's the practical application and is this actually going to help us make money I think the last big technology I wouldn't call it fail but hype cycle was web 3 and web 3 phenomenal concept around everything being super decentralized and there would be no need for any corporations or even a central government some to some extremes I think that the ideology of that is great but the practical application never never materialized I think AI is a little bit different in that it's a phenomenal uh technology that applied to so many different sectors can make things more efficient there's obviously a fear of AI coming in and destroying the current sort of uh employment infrastructure that we have today but you know other technology Cycles have occurred like this over time AI is just another one um so I don't dislike AI I love it we think about it it it helps a lot of things that we do at Sak Ventures by way of collecting information writing and putting out content great utility I've seen a number of companies in this space that I think that will even back but again at the end of the day is it helping companies to get access to Capital better products and better Services that's the question that it has to answer regardless of what the te underlying technology is yeah you know we hear I know I hear dozens of pitches I know you hear a lot of pitches as well companies will say there's there's AI in their product you you kind of get under the hood you you do a demo you use the product and you see there's really not how are you from a high level dilen in AI opportunities that come across your table often times these deals are are pretty hot you know they're moving quickly um at least there's a lot of fomo created around the opportunity from the founder perspective but how do you all how do you all think about diligen in in AI opportunity that comes across your desk that you're interested in but you're not sure H is this actually proprietary or not one of the I'm not a technologist and in order to fill that Gap there's a couple of people on the team that I trust who really know that space Ryland Donaldson and one of Sak's Guild members or advisers Garland Moore whenever I'm looking at a technology and the application layer if I can't understand it and it's going sort of the toward the Deep Tech sector I always bring in these experts to help me understand hey is this actually doing what it says on the back end and to the point where I have to do that that's when I start to feel like oh this is a company that's actually building the tools like the internal wiring behind what is making this technology work the surface level things where it might be a b Toc application and they're utilizing AI for some superficial purpose that's not necessarily the underlying Tech and to me the difficulty in scaling that is you're now marketing a product which takes a lot of spend and you're not essentially building a tool that can be used for multiple types of other companies doing the same thing that they're trying to do with uh marketing so that's the thing we're looking for if we're looking at AI the most attractive opportunities are ones that are building the pics and shovels the tools that are fueling the companies that are actually utilizing Ai and those are I think harder to understand hence the reason why bringing outside experts to help validate those opportunities no that's interesting and Kevin I want to shift back to you know your time as an LP a little bit right you you spent time there I think for five or six years or so and curious to hear how you developed Frameworks around decision-making from investing in funds to saying hey this is a red flag I should double check with the general partner or the specific Venture Capital firm or whatever asset it was at this time about this or I should ask them these questions what decision Frameworks carried over from the lp side to now how you think about decision making as a as a GP yeah I really like this question because I think about again as I mentioned investing in general through the lens of Frameworks and if you're an LP and looking at a GP or even if you're a GP looking at a company you still have to ask these following Universal questions one at the high level what type of Investments are you looking for as an investor if it's a fund then you're looking for series a funds that do X Y or Z into X categories if it's a company you're looking for these types of companies in these sectors so it's really just that high level question the second one is how does it add to the portfolio it needs to be additive can't be something that's going to be less impressive or add less potential upside as companies or funds in your existing portfolio the second one is what is our process or the third one is what is our process of due diligence and are we sticking to that uh when I was in LP we had a system of things that boxes that we checked and we went through that like religiously we do the same exact thing as VCS we have internal Frameworks and we have checkboxes of things that we must gather things that we must know in order to move forward and the last two questions are how do we approve the investment who's involved in that process and what do we need to see do we are we writing a memo uh how many references are we collecting Etc and then the last one is probably the most important is how do we monitor the investment monitor the investment going forward are we having regular quarterly check-ins are we meeting with individuals at their annual meeting are how of how are we collecting information to keep up up excuse me keep up to date with what happening with those companies so that's essentially the process so I I look at it like there the process is no different as a GP as an LP or even if you're investing in the public markets it's like if you can answer those five questions and develop a process for how you're doing things to me your process is what leads to long-term performance versus just getting lucky on something because you got lucky but you were making a bunch of mistakes along the way and I forgot what book I read where they talked about this it's like if you follow a process and that process is well thought out and it makes sense and something goes wrong you can't be upset that it went wrong you should be upset if you look back and you didn't follow your process and that to me is has made a huge difference in how I think about investing is that that structure of process Kevin I really appreciate this perspective because you know there's there's a couple of podcasts that are out there doing a really good job of kind of demystifying how LPS think about Investments I know swimming with allocators by Ernest s um is a really good one Samir Kaji has a really good one called Venture unlocked but uh another question on this tangent for you is how do LPS sort of think about alignment with the prospective funds that they want to invest in from you know a thesis perspective and and also how do they build conviction around emerging managers at fund one and and fund two any Frameworks that you can provide for us around around that Insight I think people who have developed strong conviction around emerging managers are those who've had success investing in them and I'll say this with a grain of salt many of the most SU successful funds that are in the market that have been around and sort of brand names many of them sold or they might continue to sell on the success of their funds one two and three and there are characteristics to those funds that make them more successful and again this is my opinion but to a certain degree it's an educated one because I've seen it those funds earlier funds are usually smaller they generally have a very concentrated focus on maybe one or two or three different categories the decision making process was really clean and it was a one fun strategy it was like we're going to focus on early stage now as those funds get more successful they have a preed early stage a growth and in some cases they might even have a fund where they're purchasing public so then they're doing all these different things and they become these massive institutions so when I think about just the evolution of uh you know how funds evolve and why people like these earlier smaller funds it's usually they like that sort of narrow focus and concentrated strategy and LPS today especially with the pool of emerging managers that are coming out are looking for sort that next Founders fund or that next Sequoia capital or that next Coastal ventur or whoever it might might be because I think that there is something about being able to get in on the ground floor with a firm and a manager that shows the potential to really grow into an Institutional level organization and that's the hope that you're looking for you know I I actually been thinking about this question a lot especially in the last two or three years but I've just been so many emerging managers come to Market and the difficulty that LP's fac with making the decision of is this the right one that I'm going to back I think that it's a it's a great opportunity because there just such a wide set of opportunities to choose from but unless you can have that framework of what you're looking for and I think that LPS who have done it before are going to be the ones to benefit because they've seen kind of how that system works and how they can actually be profitable there yeah that's really interesting and hopefully that will resonate with a lot of the founders that listen or or founders of funds that listen to this podcast we have a pretty diverse audience of early stage preed seed series a startup Founders um a couple of fund managers that we have gotten spec a specific and direct feedback from on how they enjoy the podcast so appreciate that Insight Kevin and as we wrap up this conversation right sarak is is a young firm that has made some really exting Investments early on maybe you can walk us through you know a couple of those deals that you all have done already and and why you had conviction in the team or or opportunity in in Tam as well yeah absolutely you know again just going back to just to frame that question you know the general thesis at Sak is that entrepreneurship entrepreneurship is the future of work and for the last several decades there's been a a paradigm shift in the relationship of employer to employee you know employers are no longer rewarding employees for just longevity but their creativity and their ability to innovate and I think there's obviously some examples like Google where they reward people for spending their free time or they give them time to just create and come up with new ideas and I think also one of the other things what that reinforces is that our society is moving toward this entrepreneurial mindset where companies expect their employees to create and they're rewarded for that so one of the things that that has yielded is this whole thing about the Creator economy and people creating content that is consumed in a completely different way than it used to 10 years ago most people are consuming on their mobile and at home and one of the companies that we backed called bum they created a a tool to help creators better monetize and not monetize but better monitor all of the income that they're receiving from the content they're they're creating online and they've teamed up with MasterCard to help those creators obtain Capital that they need to grow their business and this company has had explosive growth in fact they just sent me their last numbers they more than quadrupled their year-over-year revenue from 23 to from 22 because of this surge of craters that are out there and that entire Market by 2026 is suspected to be half a trillion dollars in Market size and it continues to grow but it's just another example of a great company that's not only expanding access to Capital but it's providing this platform to help create ERS in this new economy to be more entrepreneurial and then another company solo funds super excited about what they're doing it's a peer-to-peer lending platform that is allowing people to borrow and lend one to another in small dollar increments most of the time if people need small dollar loans it's very difficult to get that from a traditional bank so they've set up and designed a payback mechanism and a and catering to these types of borrowers such that they can get the money they need for small things so they don't end up into credit traps and ruining their financial history in the long term so companies like these that were really excited about that fit those themes thematically and we'll continue to look for those going forward yep I love it I love it yeah those are two interesting companies I know you have a few more that we've talked about as well but you know we'll keep it at at that for for the podcast and last last question or or Point Kevin I know you're based in Oklahoma City which is a a burgeoning startup ecosystem that has a lot of momentum behind it why is Sak in in Oklahoma and and what advantage do you have of being kind of centrally located in the country when it comes to to to deal flow well I started the firm here and I'm originally from OK from Tulsa originally and moved out of state lived in Chicago then we moved back to Oklahoma City which is where my wife is from and all the things I didn't Venture as a GP as an LP we're all here I think that one of the benefit of working in a small but fast growing economy like OKC is really the support you have from your peers and Business Leaders to succeed especially when you're building a company like a BC firm that has the potential to back transformative technologies that are going to grow ecosystem you know in the last year when I was thinking about where I've been I've spent a lot of time in LA Chicago where used to live and in New York City and living in Oklahoma City in the middle of the country makes it so much easier to get to all of those places which expands our access to entrepreneurs all over the country you know we don't have an Oklahoma Centric Focus but the ease of transport to all these amazing markets including the one that we're in just enhances the overall portfolio overall but I will say that Founders in I wouldn't call them overlooked parts of the country but growing parts of the country they're very Scrappy and they have thrived for a very long time doing more with less I can name a bunch of examples of companies that have had great outcomes because of that but we're right here in the center of it and it's a great time to be building a VC firm in an area where it's the next big wave coming to the shore I think the waves that are near the shore are great but the ones that you want to ride kind of surfer analogy are the one are the big ones coming that you can't see but you know are developing and that's how I think about smaller markets around the country great Insight Kevin this has been a really fascinating uh deep dive on on how you think about life as an LP how PS make decisions and and funds and and fund managers and then also how you think about sarak and your thesis unfolding and developing through the real dollars being put to work so how can a Founder who's listening to this conversation get in touch with you is there a form on your website or or anything like that there is a form on the website on the Founders page that people could fill out but if anyone wants to get in touch with me directly the best way is just contacting me on LinkedIn it is the preeminent platform in my opinion for reaching anyone so reach me on LinkedIn Kevin Joseph Moore I'm out there awesome Kevin really appreciate your time today thank you for joining no thank you",

    "transcript": "the degree of discipline that you need to have in order to do this at a high level is unlike anything I've ever done before in my entire life I played High School sports I've played division 2 basketball I've done a lot of things that required like a lot of discipline but this is like no [Music] other hey everyone uh Welcome to our first episode of Alone Together uh this is the first podcast uh that talks about solo GPS in the Venture community at least the one I've done uh I'm Mike Ma I'm managing partner of a newly minted fund uh that we just our first close at side cut Ventures and and I really when I did this I wanted to start talking to other solo GPS who are doing what I'm doing um as um I've gone through the fundraising process and and and started on my own firm it's just been really inspirational for me to meet with other people and so I wanted to make a podcast and bring my friends together uh and really just chop it up and give an honest unfetter talk about the stuff that we go through uh it couldn't be a better person to to chat with first than my friend Kevin Moore uh as Ventures um and I've known Kevin for a couple years I think my favorite story story to think about us is when we were at um when we were at culture shift and you were afraid you weren't going to make your flight home and there was a good chance that you're were gonna come stay with my house to like come crash with the family um so it's with that was is with that thought uh that I was really excited when I thought about the podcast about doing this I just send you a text like hey would you do this and you said hell yeah so while you didn't end up in my home actually you are here here virtually uh and this is my very messy office why I won't turn my camera that way towards so with that I'll just you know thanks for coming on uh and being my first victim I mean guest no thank you for having me I do remember that story and I never ever had problems flying in or out of New York maybe one time because of the weather but usually it's been pretty smooth yeah well I don't know what was going on that weather that day but it was it was something I was just I remember like did you get homeo and you know what was really cool about this this sets up the um I think this sets up the the podcast uh we knew each other as people before investors and what's been really cool in in the year and a half or two years I don't even remember since we've actually co-invested in some deals uh we've talked fundraising and I I consider you a a friend in the industry and I thought that was um a good uh back drop for this podcast because we're all out here being solo GPS and um solo GPS get a lot of shade a lot of hate I think in in a lot of misunderstanding at least in the community so I just thought uh we would just have a conversation and just kind of talk about uh what you're building not so much to like pitch and why I'm so good and do chest beating but just to have an honest conversation about uh what's going on and uh and give people an inside look under the covers no I like that I I've been toying around with a Blog D sitting in my blog sort of cat catalog of this sort of movement of solo GPS and is this the new thing and what are the benefits pros and cons of that I think was it stepstone who wrote a paper about this as well I've been thinking about it quite a bit so if we can discuss that that'd be cool too and you know the solo GP life is I think very very very similar to being a Founder at a tech company because you are kind of out there on your own A lot's depending on you and we have to think about technology systems all different things so it's a great idea to start something like this because we're goingon to you're going to hear a lot of different stories of how people think about this life completely I'm here for it so let let let me jump in with that with you talking about this life tell me about your life like tell me about prak just what in God's name Led you in your life to to this little part and go back far back as you want on this because I always think this is a when you say being a solo GP is tough or like a Founder I think it's like at least the fundraise process has been like stabbing myself in the eye so I'm always curious what have you done in your life to deserve this lot you know I'm reading this book that talks about people who had like turbulent upbringing or that tend to be uh entrepreneurs when they get older and a lot of that had to do with their ability to handle stress and I think that there's some truth to that because my upgrading was not smooth so experiencing turbulence and my career life is always comparative to the feelings that I had when I was growing up when I graduated from college I went to work in financial services and that wasn't my first career I'm very non-traditional VC I got my degree in civil engineering and then I went into Finance wanting to help people you know I didn't grow up with a lot of money so I wanted to help people manage theirs and that was really empowering so did that for like six years then I went into more a regulatory like government style job working at the Federal Reserve Bank which was really a pause to think and reflect on what I really wanted to do long term and that was returned to this desire to build my own firm run a VC firm and at that that time I was thinking whether it's going to be private Equity VC investment I'm not sure but VC seems to check seem to check the boxes on all the things that wanted to do so worked in that for close to 10 years at a VC firm here in Oklahoma City where I'm at then I went to work on the institutional side learned a little bit about how fund of funds works and just institutional investors and then got to a point where I felt like I'd learned enough to start my own firm and take this approach to doing something different that other people in the industry weren't and that was the that was the that's the short story history of Sak Ventures and to now actually be doing it is the realization of a dream that started like almost 20 years ago it's wild you you said um VC tried Tech The Tick the boxes that PE did can you say more about what some of the boxes are uh and um well when I was investing in the yeah when I was investing in the public markets at at Morgan Stanley it was really exciting to work in an office that was getting shares of Facebook allocated so people could invest in that company the Brokers running around the office like chickens with their heads cut off trying to figure out how they're going to get an allocation for their clients and when Tesla was like $30 and looking at all these tech companies and whenever I started investing my own money years ago I was mainly focused on technology companies and I was use I was investing in things that were around me things that I was using whether it was sand dis with the USB drives I had an Apple phone in 2008 so I bought Apple stock literally at that time Apple was like 30 bucks and the feeling about getting into Venture was I'd love to get closer to these companies before they go public and Venture is like the perfect platform to allow that but also one to build and invest in companies Venture allows you to get close to a lot of different types of Technologies and sort of weave your way in and working with these Founders who kind of want your help and your Capital to help them accomplish big things so Venture was a good fit and maybe this is some sort of psychological thing but I love living in uncertainty yeah I don't think that's a trait that many people outside of this industry kind of see but the uncertainty of it doesn't bother me like I that it's very exciting to me and Venture is is all of that and more yeah I want to get to to mat but I want to jump back to one thing that you said because so much resonates with me when you talk about being Venture and you drew a line to your life of not having a lot of money and and wanting to help people like how can you can you connect your like why you picked this area into what your Kevin Moore the person was and and why why these why these lines are so important for you between your your your personal LIF life and your your investing life I think the number one uh the number one thing about Venture Capital that I'm able to do now through SRA Ventures is this whole mindset of access and accessibility venture capital is one of the most powerful wealth creation tools this country has ever seen when you think about companies that were Venture back in the stock market and what they've done whether it's Google Microsoft Amazon all these companies were Venture back but historically in this country people like me haven't thought about Venture Capital as a thing that should be included in something that they can invest in nor were the the legal system set up such that regular people could even access it so I think that tide is changing a little bit with not only laws but also more people like me to go out into areas around the country to talk to investors who have means they have resources Financial Resources to include something like this they just need visibility and education on it and I know one of the things that I mentioned or I was thinking about in our sort of precursor to this call is why net new investors are important to Surak Ventures for me it's a a huge Testament to look at our LP base and say that roughly 70% of our investors have never invested in Venture Capital before I mean that's a big deal but a lot of that stems from what I did when I was working as a financial adviser going into places in the market where I didn't see other people that were down there talking to people who had means they just needed the visibility of of this particular opportunity being in Oklahoma provides in a phenomenal opportunity to talk to people with tremendous resources but they just don't have access to the VCS that are on the coast so I feel like we're well positioned to build a firm that is supported by people that are excited about this space and they can do it with someone that can talk to them in a manner that's accessible easy to understand transparent and provides them with all the things that everyone else has had access to for decades and to do that in a in a manner that um is also in line with what we're trying to do as a firm with providing access to Capital to Founders that traditionally don't have it so it's like The Best of Both Worlds man you said so much I want to tuck into and you hit like four or five questions that that span our friendship and and uh but before like just a level set for people and I know we didn't want to hear and pitch and why you're the best but just for context and you you you've talked about sarak and access uh can you just double click a little bit to set up the rest of the conversation on St ventur your your thesis and what you're interested in investing in our thesis is quite simple we are an early stage Venture Capital firm that invests in Founders and geographies that are underserved by mainstream investors my background is in financial services so naturally I look at a lot of we look at a lot of companies in that space fintech sector that maybe it's lending or new Financial products or accounting products think the Paradigm has shifted in how people think about work and technology and security so the future work vertical is really interesting to us as well so thematically that's what we're looking for as a firm and we've made a number of Investments so far that sort of tick all of those boxes Founders who are in geographies that don't get much Venture love they're they have a strong Affinity with the customers that they're serving meaning that they can intimately relate to the problems because they were those customers and they also have the industry experience to actually build solutions for the problems of people in that in that community in fact one of the deals that we're co-invest on solo funds when you think about the story of those guys y growing up in sort of urban Cincinnati and building Rodney said I mean just to keep it real I I sourced them when I was at the HBCU Founders fund and R was like I think the verbatim was like this is how we loan money in the hood this what like it was straight up and I was just like okay exactly that's what he said and I and these aren't my words this is his in the diligence Callum that those were like okay um and I think that resonates so many different ways yeah so I mean that that's a just a great example of a company that has access to this uh group of customers that a lot of people don't understand and now they have over two million people using this platform I mean it's insane so those type of things motivate us right the riches and the niches right and and and to find CER now will you do will you do a coastal deal I mean look and I want to talk because you you represent OKC hard um but and I want to talk about uh unseen ecosystems unseen but what you'll do you'll do Coastal deals right you'll do New York Bay Area but that's just do I have that right yeah we have companies uh in La New York Boston some near DC we have one in the South we have a company here so yeah we're we're open to Opportunities I think starting s back out we wanted to focus on areas where we had a natural sphere of influence so I spend a lot of time in Southern California so I know a lot of people out there been I spent a lot of time in New York as you know and U I live here yeah so why why you know look every time I I think about Oklahoma City I'm like oh you gotta talk to C I mean I think of you like so you rep you rep Oklahoma City hard uh why and what what sort of uh what at first what at first it was it was one of those things where I didn't think about it like being a pro to Sak Ventures that we were here in the middle of the country but now I look at it where investors think about it as such a huge differentiator that we're sort of outside of the group bank and have closer proximity to deals that maybe other people aren't seeing and thinking about but also thinking about it from the standpoint of really doubling down on this idea that just like we don't think about Founders have to check the box on certain things in order to build amazing companies neither do we as a as a ventured Capital firm so I've really embraced the differentiation there because I've been in all those markets I have networks in all those markets and understand from from a different perspective what I think a lot of managers don't I've been on both sides of the lp GP side and traveled around the world and technology has not only lowered the barrier for people like me building firms but it's also lowered the barrier to bring new types of Founders to the market that just weren't able to before so I think that the like you when it comes to a solo GP there's been this massive paradigm and technology and accessibility and visibility that even allows that to happen and that's sort of what I started to write about in my blog post that I haven't published yet is that I don't even know if being a solo GP like we're doing would have been possible 25 years ago at least not like a scalable standpoint no way not with the attch in the ecosystems I mean I think to be honest we have Co to thank better worst a lot for that I don't think it I don't think it would have been at all you know all that being said though like what so so but here you are um tell me tell me about like what are some of the things that make the the solo model worthwhile for you because you youve you're you're ahead of me in terms of the fundraising game um what sort of has been the most rewarding uh and and maybe also most challenging parts of of of going it alone let's talk about the challenging Parts first okay because I think people will find that inter interesting the degree of discipline and that you need to have in order to do this at a high level is unlike anything I've ever done before in my entire life you know I've played High School sports I've played division 2 basketball I've done a lot of things that required like a lot of discipline but this is like no other it is a full out grind because I think about a VC firm there are four parts to every firm you have your fundraising which is effectively your sales your marketing which is talking to VCS going to conferences you have your internal operations which is a bunch of other stuff whe whether it's fund Administration or legal and then you have working with Founders and when you're a solo GP you don't have good systems setup or especially in the beginning you got to take care of all that stuff and you can't let any of it lit so my thought is one of the hardest things about this journey has been doing all of that and now that we've built a team we can do that at a high level such that I'm not carrying the burden but in the beginning it can be really difficult all right so anyways we're back a little technical diff difficulty um we were just starting to talk a little bit about um the Journey of being a solo GP and um I think we have a lot of bumps and bruises uh through the way so I'm just curious about what what are some of the tips that you have about um being a solo GP um stuff that you may not tell everyone but just for in our little Enclave of people who are are um nuts like us any thoughts we are nuts uh yeah I think I I I'll share a story on how I got started because then there'll be some nuggets in there from that whenever the idea of this was kind of gestating the first thing I started thinking about was I made a list of people who could potentially back the firm and among that list were just individuals that I knew High Network people and just before I was getting ready to go talk to these people I had this idea that instead of trying to raise capital for the fund maybe I should raise some Capital so I can actually get the fund going it's a smaller investment amount it effectively was the organizational expenses that I need in order to get it going and the organizational expenses for a fund can range from usually in an LPA they're like up to $250,000 for larger funds it can be bigger than that but for most emerging funds $250,000 is I mean it's a quarter million dollars that most people do not have and the way that some managers will get through that is bootstrapping it and maybe they're using credit cards or maybe they're sort of saying in their LPA that they're going to pay back the those organizational expenses from uh management fees or distributions or whatever it might be and that in that includes the GP commit the GP commit is also a really big one that people have to think about so I was thinking about all different things as opposed to we just need to get investors like well there's a little bit more than that so yeah just to correct myself the fund pays for the organizational expenses the GP commit can be paid back from uh management fee reduction to the GP or through distributions from the fund that come down the line at some point and because I was talking to a lot of institutional investors I was worried that some of them might not take me serious if I didn't have enough of my own capital in the fund so I got some courage from another VC that I know who took some money from their retirement dollars and put it toward getting the fund up and going and part of my strategy was taking some of those dollars investing in some companies to show what were going to be some of the companies that the firm would invest invest in when it was up and going so I took a risk and I did that took the first investment was $50,000 into a a company the second one was 25,000 and then the third one was 50,000 in fact the first one was solo funds I put $50,000 into solo funds from my own money to show conviction that hey this is the type of company that I would like to back if we had a bigger pool of capital and that was just absolutely critical in demonstrating conviction to LPS that my money was where my mouth was Y and it ALS no I was in the same boat I mean I I I did half that amount I did 25 into solo funds it's my own money um and that was what I went to Market with my fun zero um now I think you and I are you know we're in the same vintage like we're lucky that we have had some time um to amass some wealth to be able to to to do that because it's not an easy thing to do um but no that was exactly what I did I mean the same thing that fun one is basically just institutionalizing my process that I did as an Angel um on on my own money and my own dime um and um it was hard but it I don't know if it's gonna um uh pan out uh I hope it pans out and I hope that LP do you think LP's like really give you credit for for that overall um and you and I want to talk about LPS you have a whole different view of LPS than I do and I I definitely want to get into that but do you think it works I mean you do obviously let me double click how do you know it's worked well in the beginning you what here's here's how I know it works I've talked to a lot of emerging managers who their demonstration of their investment thesis to L to potential LPS has been they are effectively paper trading into these companies where they're talking to portfolio companies and they're writing memos and doing all this work but they're not actually giving those companies any money so when an LP sees that they're more like well where's your conviction and conviction doesn't have to be $50,000 to me conviction just has to be a meaningful number where you actually sacrificing something to demonstrate that conviction whether it works out or not we won't know statistically most companies that we back early on won't so I think that that's an understanding that you have to reconcile with and if you can't reconcile with that fact then you shouldn't be a VC so I think that it it definitely works even if no one tells you explicitly that it doesn't because it does yeah so I think that that's number one number two you really have to have a strong conviction to take those types of dollar amounts to invest your money into something to demonstrate that this is what I want to be doing for the next 10 years of my life or longer and I'd been doing this long enough to to really feel that way and also what if it does work out and let's say I never do the fund at the very least I have exposure to these companies that I think are going to grow so it's a win-win for me either way so when I went to go ahead no keep going when I went to talk when I so I went to think about launching I was like okay I know I need to get that part finished but also need some working capital to get the fund up and going so all the solo GPS out there who either have started or thinking about starting see if you can find someone that really likes you and provide them with a well put together presentation about what you're trying to build and that's what I did I put together like full pitch deck not just outlining the fund that I was Raising but the firm that I wanted to build yeah and I met with an angel investor who I'd met years ago and I said to him you know I was orig going to talk to you about being an LP in the fund but I really like to talk to you about investing in my man code so I can get some money to get this thing up and going and I shared with him that bigger vision and he said I have backed a lot of Sounders and they didn't have near near as well put together presentations as what you did about what you're trying to do so I think that was a very wise and I'm very thankful for him and the opportunity even know someone like that do that but that was the launching pad to give me the confidence to literally quit my job and go 100% in this I was going to quit my job or resign from my job anyway but that made it so much easier but it was very strategic to say okay I can get this thing up and going faster if I don't have to worry about that Capital let let me let me get some specifics you dropped a lot of knowledge in there so one you did Angel Investments on your own and sourc them and did the whole thing um and let me go through a laundry list I almost want to make a packing list for solo GPS uh to so you did some sol yeah on your own um you sold the piece Manco that's a big deal dude I don't know if I very small okay how did you know I mean so my question was like how did you know when you were ready like how many how many deals how how much Capital how much your Manco and you don't have to get into specifics because like you said everything scales right I I think I think you could execute the same you drop a zero off your check and my check I think if you can show a consistent track record of you know these small check if it's meaningful for you you could do the same thing but like what is your packing list you're like okay I feel like I'm ready or the the packing list where the market tolds you're ready sold little my Manco this did this many deals allocated this much capital in a fund zero can you give me or the listeners soj be's like broad Contours of how to think about what Readiness looks like amongst this and other axes so those three things you mentioned and also sort of the pre-work actually if for people not to self-promote but I had wrote a I wrote a book called starting your own Venture investment fund from SC like a how-to guide but a lot of this stem from my experience when I worked as a financial advisor at Northwestern Mutual they taught you how to sell and one of the things that they made you do before you got hired was go out and assess your network you had to sit down with 10 people and ask that person do you think I'm the type of person that could actually build at my own financial services company and why and part of that was a weeding out process but a lot of it was sort of a a test to see if you could go out there and talk to people about build like your business and there were so many people who couldn't do that not that they didn't have the network they just weren't willing to put themselves out there and do that and I did it was great I did really well in that job but took the same approach to building this company I was like okay before I go out and do any that Angel Investing talking to invest talking to a potential anchor whatever I need to go out there and start to talk to people and say hey I'm thinking about doing this would you want to learn about that when I actually launch it and just developed a list of people who I knew I would call on immediately when the thing got up and going makes sense and I think that some people skipped that step and not not sure how many people that needs to be but it is an instrumental part of that journey of discovering how you build visibility and interest in what you're doing so you don't get out there you're starting from day one after you've quit everything you did before yeah man this is a Lean Startup for GPS right and it's so simple right we people get so caught up in Cara and this angelist deal and this Syndicate that like how about you just do this talk to 10 people have coffee and take the music take the feedback and see what you know um we have a same in our house if if enough people tell you you're drunk you should lie down like some of it is just like just just test it uh it doesn't require any capital and to be honest with you if you want empathy with with Founders this is what we ask Founders to do right do Lean Startup Capital efficient tests if you can't do that yourself it's going to be a tough may not be cut out to be a VC I was talking to a Founder who she was having some problems with her product and I said well how many how many people have you interviewed and talked to about your product to get a better understanding of how you should build it she was like oh I haven't really talked to many people and I don't know if I don't want to single her out but I do think that we're living in a society where technology has dominated so much that the human interaction has become a lot sort of push to the side but the essence of doing that is effectively what people should do yes talk to your potential customers figure out what they want and then build a pro build a product that meets that particular need or demand not the other way around don't build a solution and then do it after fact so I think that's what most sales organizations when they were like trying weed people out that's what they were trying to get us to figure out is like do you even have the market to do this and that's what I spent a lot of time doing before uh launching Sak but that's what I did before to another firm so you know these are like basic things to me yeah and and I I do think people skip this and and I I can't tell with how many Founders I talk with like they're goingon to prototype I had I had to talk with a Founder this morning about this he's like oh we need more engineering that's the thing I like how many people you talk to like well how do you know the requirements who have you talked to oh this you know this particular Healthcare System like where's the paper where's the LOI right you and it's like oh I haven't talked to them yet I haven't asked for it that's it that this is the problem and I think when we live in a world of AI and where it's easy to produce um I think what you're talking about Rings true and uh is is if you want to succeed in the world of tech and AI I think the goal particularly for where we invest early State it's about finding and being a better human yeah and you got to be your I mean and you got to go first and then go talk to those 10 and then see those commits and then take the six people that said like you are crazy right right you should not do this you you should not do this now as an entreprene right now as an entrepreneur and people like that we'll probably take that as like I'm gonna prove you wrong I'm definitely going to do it but I I balanced that Mike with thinking about like the modern era of venture capital where how do you use technology to enable you to do that faster it doesn't eliminate the activity or the task of doing that but I've been thinking about AI a lot and how do we as VCS integrate that in our practice for finding L PS or finding Founders or building visibility among other VCS there's all these different things I think it's all about taking all this data and connecting the dots but not elim using it to enhance the human element not eliminate I definitely don't want to lose SI sight of that but I need to get better at that for sure how how can I ask how you're using it today uh I'm not using it today that's what I'm saying I want to use it I want to use this technology to enhance what we're doing to go deeper faster I just haven't figured out how to program that into our ecosystem but it's not for lack of desire a lot of it's for lack of time gotcha now I've been using it hardcore for helping writing memos but I you I'll be honest too it's like you know the way ID diligence Founders and their activities that I'll I'll use AI models to help me understand behaviors and and really you know go deep in this psychology and and grit aspect of it and and and and work with unstructured data in ways that would have taken me a long time before and I'm I'm I'm still experimenting I haven't done the deep sea thing since that news broke today or the last two this this past week um but I I do believe I'm like you I I think the goal of AI is to build better humans and and and I I I think now while the the the National Security concerns about uh deep seek worry me a little bit but the general view of like compute llm going to zero and compute you know becoming cheaper and all this be compon ized I see as a positive signal for investors like you and me where we're really focused on the we're focused on the whole part of making carbon based life forms and then their action better and um I I think we only win when when um there're more competitors minus the Deep State Chinese thing going on um I think it's only going to be stand gain by for investors like you and me either on the investment side or our own fund op side I don't know no I I agree I've been reading about this extensively and a lot of this just came out but I hate to say this and I know that Elon Musk has had a lot of he he's produced a lot of consternation for a lot of people right now but one of the things he said about AI from the very beginning was that he wanted to make it open source and that no one company should control this technology and it should not be a for-profit technology and D think is proving him correct and that's just my opinion but when I was working out this morning listening to the news and then subsequently reading about it like I screamed in my head this is what e was talking about that this technology is so powerful that when more people have access to it the better it is for everybody in my opinion it's kind of like the internet why is the internet not free the internet being free opens up Commerce like crazy but we still have to pay for it it's like it doesn't make any sense yeah or it should be significantly reduced so it's more accessibly but it's just things like that so when I was thinking about deep seek and yes it is with a foreign state but the idea that it's open source and like 93% less expensive and there's there's still some issues with it yeah that to me is a big deal it's the right signal r the right signal it may not be the right TCH but the right signal hey can I can I go back to something and I've been wanting to talk about um with her with her time I want to talk a little bit about fundraising because you you know you said something to me at culture shift this last year that has stuck with me and and this is why I think you're one of the most intention people out there um so to set this up Kevin and I were at you know um a fundraising event and I was I was all gripped like I had talked to people and Kevin looks at me you look at me like Mike you and I know everyone in this room there's nothing new here for us to do and then and I was just like crap you're right and and you know you started talking about your net new strategy of how you raised your fund uh again without like you don't have to give up any Trade Secrets but just can you talk more about your net new aspect because it speaks so much to your background Sak about bringing new people and access but you didn't use this just as a way to like trumpet yourself it it was a very functional way to find asymmetric Capital that I wasn't competing for along with every other GP in the Under the Sun right now can you say a little bit about that strategy about like you and I know everyone here you got to go in the rooms people don't know us um I've stuck with me like like an idea in the back of my mind I can't get it out I think that the events that are marketed are great for visibility but I can't think of one event that I've ever went to where I raised money from an LP from one of them and I don't think there's anything wrong with attending them but I do think that as emerging managers especially solo GPS we have to think differently about who our LPS are going to be because the ones that are in that room want us to prove our worth before they're going to give an allocation to us especially in this environment and I'm not saying that universally they won't invest in a firm like hours or yours it's just what I've experienced so when I think about net new the idea of creating a new support base takes a lot of cre creativity and grit and part of doing what we're doing as a small firm we have the ability to be a lot nimbler we have the ability to do things a lot faster and make adjustments such that we can enter into these markets and adjust the way our presentation deck looks for someone or adjust what we're speaking or to throw sort of micro events to invite new people to things that uh we're doing that may not have ever had exposure to it so for example yeah I was going dig into that because you just said you know I I want this to be real real stuff and you just said like these micro events because you you've done the work and put all the the the the grimy you know elbow grease in um some some details and I would love to hear some stories on how you did it and and what's worked for example we did a dinner for doctors we had a few doctors in our in this fun and I was like you know we got like four or five doctors I they know other doctors so I rented a room at a restaurant and had 12 seats and I asked every doctor to bring someone that they know that was fantastic and it's a great event now I'm in communication with these doctors who many of them like I said have never invested Adventure Capital before so we're doing a series of these events to just plant the seed and educate people on the basics and I don't talk about them and say the tvpi and IR this and I'm like like here's what we're doing we're going out there we're trying to find the 25 best companies we're going to invest in these companies support them work with them and ultimately try to sell them at some point in the future to give you X return and they're like oh I I get that but it's just like so simple when you break it down like that for people who have never thought about the asset class before we also do sort of small micro events around working with other private Market funds that are outside of venture capital to host happy hours like for example there's a firm here in Oklahoma City it's a real estate investment fund we have teamed up together where we go to a Distillery we will invite people from our Network they invite people from their Network and it might be 15 or 20 no it might be like 10 or 15 people there but it's like movers and shakers in the city who are just one there to meet other movers and shakers but we're there to just sort of be normal and Casual with them we don't talk about business it's just like a friendly event and then at the end of it you're like hey it was great connecting let's grab coffee and then when you have coffee that's when you do the connection and explain a little bit more about what you're doing I have picked up investors from that again people who said to me I'm investing in Ventures cuz I thought about venture capital and private markets I just never knew anyone that was doing it so XYZ later they're investing in the fund so it's just think like smaller things like that that we have the opportunity to do and maybe the last point I'll put on this is sort of my theme for 2025 is to grow where I'm planted and the the benefit of that is thinking that I don't have to talk to all of these investors around the world who everybody knows but there are people right where I'm planted who have resources and and want access to what I'm doing I just have to put in the work to find them and also make what I'm doing easy to understand such that they can get on board and be people who can support me long term so that's sort of my that's been resonating with me like and I'll tell it to the people grow where you're planted and don't worry about all these things that you're seeing in the market because there's so much opportunity right where you are you just have to figure out how to exploit it so okay can you I love that grow where you're planted there's abundance everywhere um can you say more about that because like look the objection is like oh my God these checks aren't going to be big enough uh you know I have a 25 million cover on my fund I don't know what your I I forgot what yours is but 30 million 30 Milli like can you get there I mean and and like the size of these checks to to run all these down how do you manage all these LPS what are your what's your answer to that like so when we first when I when we sort of made this decision to start doing that we were sort of hovering and stuck at a number then when we say all right we're going to double down for the next six months just to test this thesis and then our largest investor is here they put in a $5 million check and a lot of it had to do with just doubling down on what we're doing here spending more time with them different things and for a $30 million fund a $5 million check is a is a really big deal congrats yeah so that reinforced this idea of man we just need to really grow where we're planted but philosophically the extension of that also pertains to our portfolio companies where we just backed a company in Birmingham Alabama and these guys are harnessing uh their talent and Technology to serve a a base of customers right in their Community had no one is thinking about and it just resonates with me to be like man these guys are growing where they're planted planted and this technology has enabled them to build this amazing business and access customers that uh need what they're doing but if these guys were thinking oh we're in Birmingham we need to start competing for customers in New York and San Francisco and Chicago they probably wouldn't be doing as good as they are so now I look at it as concentric circles both for Founders like them and for firms like ours we need to strengthen and do the best that what we have with where we are and then as we grow we can start expanding the circle of our LPS regionally then nationally and then ultimately as we're raising bigger funds internationally and that's how I think about the evolution of Sak LPS ask us well tell us about what you're trying to do fund three and four it's like well for fund one I think that the majority of our support is going to come from around here fund two and so forth it's going to expand but to raise a venture like a scalable firm you kind of have to build build your a solid foundation and then grow from there but I think a lot of emerging managers start to focus on the outer concentric Rings before really building that solid foundation right where they are guilty I mean guilty like and so so count me in that group I I want to I mean like I want to ask about this 5 million dollar anchor without know like but like do they invest because you're going to have an an Oklahoma City thesis or was it just like all the work you put in validated the the the grower planted you just put in the Reps and they're like look we get it we've der risked enough we've watched you we have fer you be in Oklahoma City but if not we you know we're just backing you because of your T how and then how did that ladder with these I mean for me my individual checks you know kind of like the 2500k range I like pick these off one at a time how did you balance both the to use since you played basketball the inside game and the outside game I think a lot of people assume that if you're in Oklahoma or wherever you might be that investors just want to invest around there but I think that part of the benefit of uh talking to investors in smaller markets is they want visibility and exposure to The Best of Both Worlds and fact that we're and here but we're investing in opportunities in all these different markets is a plus and I've not been told by any investors who are sort of geographic or regionally focused to the extent that they are not going to participate in us most investors say man we love the fact that we can get exposure to companies in on the East Coast or here in the middle so that really wasn't that that really has not been an issue with anyone that were investing that hasn't invested with us it's been more of a A plus yeah that's that's great I that's not been my experience like I I I deal with all these Regional Economic Development like like we have all this money if you invest in this ZIP plus 4 region you know something I'm being a little exaggerated but it's like okay well um well one of the things that I said to one of our newest investors and I said this to a bunch of people in Chicago as well when I was talking to them and I don't have any investors in Chicago I used to live in Chicago I find it surprising I don't have any investors from up there but this is quite profound what I'm about to say people who think like that they say we're going to back managers here that can support Founders here so I'm like okay well if you take the same approach to trying to do something different how do you expect anything to change what makes more sense is to back a manager like me who's looking at your market for a different perspective to identify opportunities that the managers that you want to be there don't see and this just completely changed the perspective of what they were saying because it's almost counterintuitive to say I want to back managers that are in Chicago to back Chicago based Founders I'm like okay well do you because if you back managers there that are already doing what they're doing and they're and nothing's really changing in your ecosystem how do you expect more Chicago based Founders to get funded you need someone like me looking at the market from a different perspective to find those Founders that the managers there don't that aren't investing yet I said this to another state and they were like that's such a good point and then they back us because that mentality just fundamentally does not make any sense yeah I I I again I grew up in Ohio you know so Brown sorry U I've been I've been home um trying to run that same Gambit and I got to tell you I haven't gotten that love with it you know we want in Ohio for Ohio and you know from Ohio I was like I'm from Ohio but and I and I said the same thing it's like I'm I'm from here and I'm not from here I can help br the Gap and I right I crit you because I haven't gotten that I've tried to run that Ploy but it's been it's been you know I I have to say I don't think it's I don't think the lp the regional LP Community feels that way universally I I I I would say it's more contrarian and kudos to you to find that there's a guy here that runs a big firm in a private Equity space they do a lot of different types of Investments one of the things that he talked in his investors about was he wants to be located here and he's telling his investors he's like hey if you invest with me I'm going to invest in companies that are outside of this region but one of the things that they do strategically is work with every investment that they've made to do business here to bring their products here to bring their services here to do things here so there's this relationship between them and I just think that it's so novel to say that okay they had they built a manufacturing facility here in Oklahoma City and they're targeting companies outside of the state to invest in that need those services that this company can manufactur so when we think about the symbiotic relationship between the two it's kind of like okay you're investing money over here but now they're spending that money here it just makes so much sense so so we just have to I think that just thinking about that stuff differently and having these sort of blunt conversations with LPS whether they invest or not some of them will most of them won't but it does I think take shaking up the industry a little bit to just think a little bit differently yeah I I love that I could I could chop it up with you all day I don't know if you heard my slack going up that's actually a Founder I need to get to so no no there are a couple I I'm going to change some of the lightning round questions on you based on some of the stuff that you said um the first one is this um what's the typical uh you know what what is your typical response to being a solo GP oh what if you get hit by a bus right all that so I have two questions in the lightning rounde one how close have you ever been to getting hit by a bus please disclose and second what's your answer to to that type of objection let's start with the bus let's start with the bus have you been have you been close to getting hit by a bus I've never been close to being hit by a bus but the last time I was in New York I almost got hit by a cab but I don't think that's uncommon I I I'll get that out in edit uh all kidding aside then what's your what's your response to that objection to solo GPS if you even bother to Levy one I think that risk is everywhere but it's about probabilities and most LPA are built and designed to to think about that risk in a in a manner that um doesn't leave LP hung out to drive but also think about it from the standpoint of telling people that we're building a firm we're not just raising a fund so while that might be the situation today factually in the long term in the short term that's unlikely to happen and then in the long term as our firm grows that risk is almost eliminated because I don't expect to be a solo GP for the rest of my career ah so so GP dating you just led to the other one I'm totally changing this on you it's like um you like to give me an idea if you don't have to list the the GP itself but other solo GPS you're interested in dating or or characteristics thereof whenever I was working at the funa funds one of the things I loved about Tomas who used to be at Red Point who started theory was he had this conviction on this thesis that he just went out built it based upon what he was doing and uh his firm wasn't in complete agreement with what he was thinking about doing that they wanted to do and red Point's a great organization but I had I had a long conversation with him about what he was doing he showed me Pitch dead and stuff about what they were doing and how the conviction around that was so strong that resonated with me and I knew that whenever I was about to launch this was years years ago that that I would sort of Follow That same sort of sentiment of just sticking to what you're convicted on and not letting anyone tell you anything differently so he did I think he did a really good job of doing that that's how's like a solid GP date and and for those listeners who don't know what this I like um it feels todrey right in the solo GP I I I'm like you I you know we're we're starting together uh starting alone but I I I don't have the same desire to forever but so there's a fair amount of solo GP dating that's going on um I'm sure people in the lp Community know maybe not um but yeah I'm always interest what give me your ideal solo GP date um got uh question for you know uh for for a big pitch uh walkup music if you had walkup music before a big pitch for an LP or uh or founder what would what would be your walk up I'm a huge fan of Jill Scott one of her favorite songs that it resonates in my mind is a song called Golden and the the the chorus is living my life like it's golden so I think about that all the time how I just feel so fortunate to be able to do this job that the lyrics of that song really resonate with me yeah Jill from Philly that's right I love I love Jill Scott I love the um very cool um well listen you know I I I could talk to you all day and I couldn't have thought of and I I know there's technical things we're going to have to fix and edit and and whatnot but um I really appreciate uh hanging out with you I I wish we could do it more um and um yeah I appreciate being the first one on this podcast it's kind of like a historical moment right here I guess I guess um you know and like I said you you you were you were invited in my to take a bedroom in the house and you ended up in the virtual living room so I'm glad we did this and you actually got to go home that day but I think it's a good way to bring this all full circle for what we're doing and uh congrats on all your success and we you know I'll see you out there on the road on another cap table another call man love it thank you again for the opportunity all right man cheers be good cheers see you [Music]",

    "transcript": "hi everyone and welcome back to another episode of unlocking Venture Capital I'm here with GP Kevin Moore from Sak Ventures how are you doing Kevin I am fantastic how are you I'm good thank you so much for coming on I'm so happy that Daryl introduced us and connected us um yes Kevin please tell us about uh about yourself and about sarak and what your focus is high level I've been in finance Adventure capital for like the last 18 years the last 10 years of that has been in VC I feel like I've had the privilege of working on both sides of this business both on the VC side as an investor working with startups and also on the lp side investing into VC funds and co-investing along with them uh Sak Ventures is my baby it started it last year we're investing in seed stage companies all around the country fintech SAS Commerce enablement if you're a Founder out there talk to us uh we keep a wide aperture for the types of Founders we're looking for so we're happy to be doing what we're doing amazing and I know that you guys are based in Oklahoma and so I was wondering if there is a reason that uh that you guys are are headquartered there um or if that's just kind of how everything kind of came about in your life uh so I'm originally from Tulsa Oklahoma and moved out of state my wife is from Oklahoma City and when we came here in 2010 you know it's just a place that's experienced like tremendous growth uh my previous job took me all around the country mainly in the Bay Area s La New York Chicago all over the place so we built this network all around the country and I think Co really opened up people's understanding to to realize that you can really build an amazing business or VC firm anywhere you are in the world I've been trying to tell people yeah so for us the B laries are Limitless and being right here in the middle of the country provides us with easy access to all of the different markets that we're investing in I know that you know what what we talked about before was that you actually have a guild Network which is to support founders with I found that to be so interesting so how do founders get to know and understand and how to work with this Guild Network and do they have to currently be in your portfolio company already how does that all work because it's something that I don't see everywhere so I found that to be particularly unique unlike most VCS and I'm generalizing because I don't know this I know that I don't know everything right and I I know it's a shocker to a lot of people I don't know everything so my feeling in in building out Sak Ventures was to find people who were really good at what they did whether that was something someone who's really good at uiu or someone who was a CFO or a COO or someone who's really good at The Guild was the first step in creating that expert Network that Founders could have immediate access to so they could get the help that they need when they need it so the guild meets on a quarterly basis and if there are touch points with Founders outside of those quarterly meetings where we invite a a potential company or an existing Sak company to do a 30 minute presentation to the guild and they get that feedback sometimes we're talking about contract negotiations sometimes we're talking about uiux things but overall the concept is get people the help that they need and that network has been phenomenal in doing that in fact today we have another guild meeting with a Founder that we are considering for the portfolio amazing that is so great and you know I I think that it goes to speak about how well you're building community and how Transcendent that is across the different sectors and the different geographies so I mean great people on there we have people from Google JP Morgan Adobe I mean some really sharp people that are providing that feedback and uh it's a I think it supplements that the work that we already do with Founders it's just another value ad perfect um I know that you know the way that the market is would love to get your opinion on this that a lot of my VC friends that are usually in the associates or senior Associates or analysts they're all like very very highly ambitious very energetic people okay and um and you know you're actually one of the ones that I've actually seen come from another fun and then start your own fun because everyone and their mother wanted to start their own fun about two years ago right and so I was wondering what kind of things and learnings did you experience from when you actually made that leap that you know you kind of wish you knew then that I think a lot of our listeners would be so interested to know the biggest learning for me in doing this was fully embracing my personal story and reason for why I started SRA Ventures I mean look I told you this I think I kind of shed a little bit of color on it but not all the details and I may not go into all the details here on this call but I'm not super proud about the upbringing I had when I was a kid a lot of it wasn't my fault uh there's certain things about that that I was just embarrassed to talk to people about but I started to like psychologically look into all those different reasons and realize like oh that's my story so when I started sharing with LPS and others about like the why behind Sak Ventures the name and what it means to for me to actually do this role that's something that took me a while to embrace and I tell my wife all the time it's like man sarak has brought out something in me that I probably needed to uh come to terms with for many many years but now sarak is like my way of expressing all of those different things through the name and telling that story is something that I've gotten more comfortable with with LPS and I think that that's resonated more with people so I would tell people if you're thinking about starting a fund make sure you integrate your personal story because people really are investing in you and then the fund secondary and you know that um as you are kind of going through that first fundraising stage that first you know incorporation of your fund and everything was there a pivotal moment where you had this moment of realization did something was there like an event that that happened or something that somebody had said um in your environment that really sunk in for sure there were there were two critical moments the first was our anchor invester Dera Capital she she created in an environment in our very first meeting where she said hey let's just talk about you and your why and it was the most uncommon approach to an investor meeting that I had ever been in and it kind of just shied my perspective like oh this is different and I thought that that was very unusual but at the same time something I'd always desired because there's always more behind the numbers there's always more behind people and she was like the first in investor ever to really get to the root of like who I was and am I the type of person that's going to have the grittiness and the resilience and the perseverance to actually build something great and she brought that out of me the second thing was I joined uh this program VC include and it's like a 10 or 12we program great people running that organization shout out to renell Solomon and all the people over there but they talked a lot about that as well so it re enforced what she was saying like you got to tell your why you got to understand your why you got to embrace that so that was a big learning for me because I'd always sort of hidden behind the things that I was doing well professionally and achievements I had yeah but people look at that as like a a given of course you're smart of course you understand how this works but tell me about you and why I should back you so that those were two critical moments that were early on in the life of the fun it's kind of like you're seeing that people are taking your performance as okay you've already gotten in the door and now what's that next step kind of a thing and tell me about you and tell me about you know this and so that's so interesting because I feel like I mean our industry is so opaque as it naturally has always been that's how a lot of funds have more advantages over than others but the same with the founders and so that's how you get different deal terms from one founder to the other to the other and so um you know it's so interesting that how your personal story is something that is going to help you um have a better relationship with your other investors because I think that when things are very opaque and when you feel like you um come from a place that may be different than other people it is really hard to tell anything that makes you look vulnerable because it's like oh well okay you are the same performance level as X Y and Z other candidates for this but you have a black mark so what what what is that going to do with whoever is receiving that you know what I mean and I think that that makes it so scary for a lot of people um to kind of walk through these doors yeah and it's it's it's it's something that um when I talk to a founder or when we talk to Founders we really want to understand that part of them we started to experim we're experimenting with this thing we call the icono clastic score and this icono clastic score is like is this an iconoclastic founder someone who has sort of been in the trenches developed that grittin and resilient resilience and can that be measured in a way that we can include it in our due diligence of that particular person so I came up with we were the Genesis of this sort of idea I was running it was in the winter time and I'm very disciplined with my workouts I don't ever Miss regardless of how hot it is how cold it is I woke up six o'clock in the morning there's snow all over the ground it's dark it's kind of drizzling because it had just snowed the night before and I'm about a m a mile into my run and my knee starts hurting and I was like why am I out here and I said oh I'm out here because I'm someone who doesn't make excuses I don't it doesn't care what situ I'm going to keep doing what I need to do in order to be successful then I thought there's got to be a way to measure that in Founders so then we started working on this icono classic thing and it's turned out to be pretty revealing uh what it is so I find now that when we're talking to Founders like digging into who they are and really getting them to tell the truth about their why it's interesting and it makes it more a lot more comfortable to back those types of Founders when they're vulnerable with their weaknesses because in my opinion it makes them look stronger that's so interesting because yeah I mean that's naturally you wouldn't think that it's going to make you look stronger if you're saying something out of vulnerability and out of something that sounds very raw right um and and yeah and so it's really interesting that you say that and also uh you know that you said that you never miss a workout I literally missed my workout this morning I was like oh man I just thought about about it now um and can you share with us an example of someone who has that trait that founder of yours that you've uh you know either talked to recently or they were one of the founders that you've invested in you're like this is something that really stuck with me about their trait and how can I quantify this man it's almost like every single founder I'll tell you the very first investment that was made at Sak Ventures was into a Founder Carmel Cadet at mtech okay she grew up in Haiti Haiti is a very you know low very impoverished country and the environment that she grew up in was unlike any like you imagine the roughest environment in the United States and had is even worse so she moved to the United States when she was 16 went to college and then she ended up having this amazing career at IBM for 10 years before spinning out and starting her own company and she said that uh part of the the reason why she wanted to build this fintech that was sort of enabling Financial Freedom for others around the world was because of how she grew up and the struggles that she encountered so when you hear these stories about these Founders and their resilience people begin people think that there's this Mutual exclusivity between uh people who want to do good but also build something great but it's like every single founder in our portfolio has a story like that and it's like of course you want to back these people because they're the type of people who are going to run through a brick wall to be successful and aren't going to quit no matter how difficult it gets so that's how we are that's how I am so when I see that trait in Founders you kind of just drawn to that yeah no I I completely get it and it's also really great that you know these are these are very globally impacting kind of opportunities that people are building and it will have a ripple effect long after you know um whoever takes over and things like that so I find that to be so inspiring um for sure it's what it's what keeps me in this industry um working with great Founders and I think that that's something that you know we share and it's something that hopefully U more VCS will will share in the in the long term as well and be able to want to stay in this kind of environment and Industry and utilize your skill set for Good Hope yeah and I think that let's put on our investor hats for a moment I feel like the way you make money as an investor is you have to figure out where the opportunities are on the edges where there's some sort of at asymmetric advantage that Founders give or something that you're doing for investors and I feel like by targeting and identifying this characteristic in Founders is something that we do really well and something that is was missing from the market part of the motivation for starting Sak Ventures was just having worked in an environment that was very homogeneous and everyone seemed to be doing the same thing and I kind of got tired of that and I said there's an opportunity here that everybody's ignoring so we're going to build something different to capture that so I think that as an investor like a portfolio manager VC you have to sort of think about that and include those things are going to create Alpha for your investors and I think that that that that's a big one yeah and you know uh adding on to that as well like you know we talked about how you have um this great network of of guilds that you have provided um other startups and Founders the missing parts that they needed right and I always found that it was so interesting that especially a lot of um you know people that are starting out in this industry they want to be unicorn Hunters instead of unicorn Builders right like you're hunting for Treasure instead of wanting to build them into what you know that they can be and and providing that extra you know outside of the box thinking and help that other Founders would really need so I really do love that you guys really do help build instead of just being like Hunters everywhere because there are a lot of hunters um already and I don't know that that's really the skill set that people are going to be building on to in the future as great investors become more and more advanced if that makes sense to you yeah yeah I totally agree you know there's a a person I know here who's a phenomenal investor won't say his name but he said something years ago probably five six seven years ago that I that stuck with me he was like the reason I think I've been successful is because he's so good at getting to like that smallest in infantis business of information that he needs to know before making a decision like analyzing something down to like there's no more information to discover and I thought that's interesting and I as I we were thinking I think about this with do diligence with Founders we were on a call yesterday with a Founder that got actually got kind of contentious to a point but what we were ultimately trying to understand was like why he was making a certain type of decision we didn't stop pushing into it until he finally just revealed what it was and at the end of that we said to him now we're comfortable with potentially backing you because now we understand you as a person and why you're doing things the way you're doing cuz people like dance around the beauty of all this stuff instead of just really digging in and I think that that's something I've learned over the years from my peers and people I've worked with that to be really really good at this job you have to be afraid you have you have to be willing to ask tough questions and go really deep and to ensure that you're being a good Steward of the capital that people are giving us to invest on their behalf and this isn't play money this is millions of dollars that we're managing for people and we take that very seriously perfect and you know I I think that when someone asked me why I wanted to be a venture C I was really bad at the whole dancing thing I don't know all the waltes I didn't know any of the steps it felt and you know and some of the rules of these other kinds of types of organizations I love when a VC's job is to dig in is to ask the hard questions and is to be as straightforward as possible when you're doing the due diligence but also when you are helping them build post support like post investment support and providing okay what is that next step that you need and not every founder is going to be able to know what to answer when it comes to what other help do I need so how do you kind of bring that out of them because the other thing that I've noticed also and other um you know guests on the podcast had their own opinions about it too was about asking for help how do you provide help to somebody who does not know what they need as a Founder because if you're a firsttime you don't really know what you don't know because you haven't been in that other step that other step yet so you know um to to allow people to know that you're available but to also um know how and when to check in I'm sure is something that is really important to your strategy I think if we go a little bit deeper none of us know everything and I I fundamentally believe that and I feel like if you're working with the right founder then they have the humility to understand that there's an expectation on my behalf on my part that I know people don't know everything but if they like they do then they're not the right type of founder for us they actually could even know more than we do but no one knows everything so I think when you get in a position where mentally you feel like you don't need anyone's help you're the a a master at it which is great and you're probably not even you don't need Venture Capital but I think for most people at Seed where we're investing they do have some domain expertise in what they're doing however there's more to just that than growing a high growth company so when founders don't know what they need we know to a certain extent that they don't know that and the way that we want to work with them is are they coachable enough to accept the assistance from our Network our team members our Guild and if we can't do that and there they don't want to work with us in that capacity then we're probably not the right no I'm not going to say probably then we are are not the right investor for them because they're not the type of person that we believe can grow to be the type of leader yeah no that that's really great and and um are there any kind of red flags that are immediate red flags to you so for us it would be actually hard number criteria so if you have already come in at preed or seed with a messy cap table already and you have like so many different advisers that have taken so much different equity and all of that stuff or um if you came from a venture Studio fund that let's say didn't really help you in the way that you thought but again it went back to that messy cap table situation and the valuation is very different than what we can expect or the valuation cap is different than what we can possibly provide these are kind of automatic disqualifiers do you guys have automatic disqualifiers um that you have come across in your first fund absolutely I mean I mean I could run through the details of those but to me that's very mechanical right there are certain things that we don't want to see such as unrealistic projections or a revenue model that doesn't make any sense or I mean I'll give you an example actually not an example more of a characteristic because the way that we run our fund and the parameters that we set by way of we want to see X number of months months over month Revenue sometimes that's three months months month-over-month Revenue growth sometimes it's six month months of month over month Revenue that's kind of hard anyway um we have things like that we have valuation limits such that we don't want to invest in rounds that are post money valuation of 15 million or or higher we want to see round sizes that are below 3 million we want to see cacs at this and ltvs at that we have all those sort of standard standardized metrics but one of the most important things that I look for in a Founder is are they the type of person that understands that quite frankly these things are going to change and you're going to need to make adjustments in real time but again this goes back to what we're talking about from the very beginning is does is this the type of founder that we want to back and I try to stress this so much we can change the business the Market's going to change yep one thing that we cannot change is the founder unless the company's going well and we fire the CEO and they leave but I think that because we're investing at seed a lot of emphasis is put on them and kind of how they think about building companies and we can fill in the gaps with all the other things but I think a lot of it has to still come back to them and you know somebody told me this once and I never forgot it how like if you tell somebody somebody something that is vague and positive like a horoscope everyone will be able to attribute it to that be like that's me that's amazing that's totally me right and so when um investors and I because I have a lot of different kind of opinions of why people are in uh saying it like that so when investors are saying well it's about the founder it's about you know all these characteristics that are vague and positive like a horoscope you know uh and then I'm like no I need this kind of proof this kind of proof this kind of proof and uh and then it seems like everything that you can possibly say can be said about all the different snowflakes in the world and everyone is special and so um to provide a little bit more color can you kind of expand about like that it's about the founder and you know what is what does that really mean to you uh versus you know how do other investors kind of explain it in a general sense uh I mean it's a good question I think it's I look at in I I look at investing not in like this onedimensional plane of the founder is everything the founder is one thing and you got to have the right founder in the right Market at the right time that's right yeah sometimes it can be the right founder but the Market's not ready yet or it can be the right market right timing but the wrong founder so unless you have those three core ingredients it's just not going to work so it's not just about the founder all the time I also think that as a firm thematically they have to fit within the categories where we're good at like we love fintech we love Enterprise SAS we're looking at a lot of cyber security and embedded finance and looking at some things in the Commerce enablement space with creators and future work if there's something outside of that it could be an amazing founder but if it's not within our core expertise yeah what feel like we can bring to them then it's just not a good fit yeah and that's a really great way to to say it too because you are you do have actual focuses yeah I think that investing is about creating Frameworks yeah and if anyone's a fan of Ray Doo it's me who has these core set of principles that he lives by them right and those principles are guides that help you to stay in your lane so that you don't get off track both personally professionally financially spiritually or whatever it might be what are those principles so I feel like I've always been a good investor and the reason I think that is because I create these Frameworks for whatever medium I'm looking at at the time and stay Within in that and if it's something that's outside of that framework I'm just not going to do it and I think that we we've done that well at SRA Ventures by creating these Frameworks and then finding Founders that fit within that okay perfect awesome well thank you so much Kevin that is a wrap for our episode and thank you everyone for joining us on another episode of unlocking Venture Capital I'm here with Kevin Moore and our next episode is going to come out on Monday so thank you so much my pleasure thank you",

    "channel": "The Investor with Joel Palathinkal",
    "date": "2023-11-02",
    "transcript": "yeah and I would say what one thing that's really interesting is um being on the other side of the table so we see we see Founders that become VCS uh we see VCS that become Founders uh in your case you an LP and then you ended up becoming a VC so the skill sets and like that knowledge that you that wisdom that you have evaluating Founders I mean and fund managers especially um that really arms you to know how to profile um you know building relationships with institutions right because you kind of know how they think so I think that's definitely an edge that you would have that a typical emerging manager starting from zero would would not have so I think that's definitely um a helpful thing in your tool belt you and that goes back to the range right kind of moving around to different um Industries so yeah I think that I I still classify myself as an emerging manager I think one guy told me he was like Kevin given your experience I wouldn't call you an emerging manager I call you an alpha manager because you've invested in companies you've yeah you've invested in funds you know you understand the public markets so again I'm very very thankful and humbled to have the opportunity to do what I'm doing because and I appreciate that it's hard I appreciate you know the importance of what we do I mean to have the opportunity to in invest in a Founder who's trying to build their dreams and help them to achieve that that's a very rewarding feeling my wife she works in corporate recruiting she's a manager but she said the joy of giving someone a job that changes their life it's like it's very rewarding and I I I get that so what we do as in as VCS you know I think every founder should be treated with respect I think that they're making a sacrifice just like me to build something and you got to respect that hustle that grind so I just it just baffles my mind when I read these stories where VCS are mean to Founders I'm just like they're going through it you have to empathize with that I just I just don't I just cannot register being mean to entrepreneur just doesn't make any sense to me yeah yeah I mean I totally agree it's different personalities and and um you know I think the ones that are long on relationships I mean I've seen Founders later become institutional LPS so my only response to that is like it's a small world and it's you know those you never you know you never know where people can you know end up I mean they could you know someone that did you I mean this happened to me someone that's kind of been mean to me they've actually um this real real story like I mean this person ended up being um like a student of mine like there was a program that I was teaching like 15 years later and this person was like my my student and I was like man I should fail this person but I didn't um but you know so I think it's it's a small world and I think that if you have the opportunity to get revenge um look the best revenge is just doing well in your in your career and and and uh and just being successful that's like the most bitter Revenge you can get you're not going to get anything with um you know just doing something spiteful but just be successful and and be on top of the news feet for all those great things I feel I remember a story of a Founder who I was working with at i2e and everyone loved his technology and I've been working with him for months and we were at the term sheet negotiations so it was me him and the president of the organization in a room just a conference room so we got through everything was was like yeah that looks good that's good then we got to valuation and it was far lower than what he wanted justifiably I mean had no product no revenues like pre and he lost it he started cussing us out he was being really mean and both myself and the president we were just like eyebrows raised like what is happening right now anyway needless to say we did not do that deal yeah but it was a great learning experience to be like yeah is this someone you want to work with for the next five seven years imagine like the liability that you'd have to deal with over the years you know just um dealing with those outbursts and and just other people too that you know if you invite that person to a social setting uh and this person has an outburst and you kind and you would have your important stakeholders there there's there's collateral damage with that kind of stuff don't do that yeah I mean I I mentioned this you know I was on a panel yesterday and I mentioned this I mean I I think when times are tough you start to see a lot of people uh be a lot more on edge so everybody's raising right Founders are trying to raise fund managers are you know having trouble closing their fun so you start to see some true colors of some people in these tough times and they have outbursts like that you know and I think the it goes back to the basics of what like you learned in you know we we learn learned in our sales skills it's really just business development 10one you know it's even if you got to go old school and Shake somebody's hand you know smile uh say their name you know remember their remember their birthday I think they there was a post post that we probably both saw I think one of the Rockefellers one thing that he did was whenever he met with somebody he he really knew about their family their kids' birthdays like all those things don't go out they're not it's not out of style to really know a person's life and really uh build a relationship with them but I think a lot of us were you know we're in the Tinder generation where you know you meet well I Shar that story because it was the reverse of someone being mean to the investor it's just like now if I ever hear another investor who comes across that person they've just burnt so many britches so I guess that was the point there but I agree you know the the relationship side of this is so important and you know I won't stress enough that you know LPS you meet today might be LPS four or five years from now you know treating even treating even the small people really good could end up getting you in front of like no kidding a story of just this week I was at a university talking to this Venture Capital Club all students and it turns out that one of the students has an uncle or cousin or something just in the professional Community who I had a an investor call with them I was talking about the company he was like oh by the way my nephew or cousin was in this class that you spoke in and he was telling me about you and how nice you were to them and all the different things he like that's pretty awesome to see how something that seemed completely disconnected to something else ended up being this connection that potentially could be beneficial for the firm that happened to me with the job yeah like I mean I was teaching this I was like an adjunct teacher for like this tech school and um I helped this person just work on their resume they ended up getting a job at this fintech firm and um that person got a job at the fintech firm built a relationship with like the senior people and then coincidentally I was on the market for a new job and he put in a good word for me and I mean that person pretty much saved my career um that is awesome yeah I mean so it just you really got to be nice to everybody and you can get an edge just from doing that so well I uh yeah that's sort of",

    "transcript": "my role as a venture capitalist is to add value Beyond just writing a check absolutely I preached that so much about Venture people all the time are like hey can you help me with with meeting a VC I need money it's like it's not enough to need money you need you need what they bring to the relationship it's it's the long-term relationship yeah these companies that we invest in will be invested in them for probably more than seven or eight years so we have to be able to do more than that not only that we want to stay relevant for more than that time frame welcome to the golden group strategic growth podcast featuring expert insights interviews with thought leaders in business plan triage hosted by Kyle Golding award-winning entrepreneur CEO and chief strategic idealist for the golden group hello everyone and welcome back to the Strategic growth podcast I'm your host Kyle Golding I am joined today by very special guest Kevin Moore who is founder and managing partner sharak Ventures and has a huge long history of venture capital and financial advising in his background don't let those youthful looks fool you he extensive background and experience in business that we're going to glean from today so welcome to the podcast Kevin thank you for having me quickly just give the folks I mentioned that you're you're the founder sarak but give give people the two minute version of of your your background and what you've been doing leading up to your role at SRA I have a very non-traditional path into venture capital I started as an engineer I worked for for a financial I was a financial adviser for six years then I worked for the Federal Reserve Bank then I worked on the GP side of venture investing in companies and I've also worked on the lp side of the industry investing in fund managers and then now I'm back on the GP side running my my own firm all that occurred over a 17year period right so 17 years of of being in business finance and some way or other uh gives you a probably a pretty unique take on business finance and the startup culture Etc that's happening right now in 2024 yeah I used to think that getting into venture capital or any industry really it was a linear path you go to school you do this you do that well that's not the case in fact I was talking to someone ear today around every single experience that I've had and every single experience that people have if they have an end goal they should try to get as much from each experience because it's going to help them when they get to that ultimate objective actually my my story is not too dissimilar I spent 15 years in the music industry before I got into marketing as a creative and then more on the business development Economic Development aside the last 15 years or so so same same kind of crooked path that no one could have planned for right yeah I mean a road to success is definitely not a paved one and it's definitely not a path in fact uh one of my colleagues at Sur Ventures he has a great operating background with big tech companies and he said when he was leading these companies he would always tell people hey there's the mountain in the distance that's where we're going and we may not know exactly how we're going to get there but always keep that in mind that's where we're going and that's how I think about that's how I've thought my career especially when younger people ask me what do I need to do to do X Y or Z like set a long-term goal and everything that you do in between is going to help you get there and that's really kind of a snapshot too of how business works too right uh someone has an idea for a business and they go through the process of developing a business plan and structure financing it whether they do it internally or have external Partners get into the market and then often what works well and what didn't work as well is not what expected but you follow the opportunities right absolutely and I guess for people out there building a business right now the biggest thing I would say is be prepared for things to not go exactly how you want them to go and my mentality is things either go better than what I planned or sometimes worse than I plan but I never expect things to go exactly how I planned but also say that we should plan right we should have a framework for how we're going to get to a place and then with every single thing that happens you can adjust that framework but keeps moving forward yeah so as a GP now with sck how do you see the the the industry as over overall business in Oklahoma and the influence of venture capital you know I think anyone would argue right now is the kind of the best time ever in Oklahoma for venture capital in The Last 5 Years and and 10 years before that was better and 20 years ago was terrible so where we are today how how what's the temperature how do you feel where we're at and where do you think we're going from 2025 on if we continue at the same pace of expansion of adding more Venture Capital firms in Oklahoma then we're on a exponential growth path when I moved to Oklahoma City after living in Chicago and moving back to the State there were no Venture Capital firms other than i2e right and maybe some others that sort of fizzled out maybe there's a life science firm that that wish you life science or that one I think uh William Piva was running oh right that firm I forgot the name of it but now when you look today across the landscape there's a number of VC firms in Oklahoma City in Tulsa and I feel like it's a asset class that even in investors are starting to recognize someone said to me the other day I told them hey I work in venture capital and in my mind I'm thinking they have no idea what that is but when they said oh I get I get what that is that was like a first time ever in 14 years since I've been here where that's happened and that happened this year so I think that it's an it's an it's a industry in in nationally but to see that happening in Oklahoma city is a really good thing but I also think that it's indicative of the influence and spread of venture capital across the country such that entrepreneurship is so much more accessible because of Technology because of virtual work because of Transportation I mean even with our airport we can fly to New York to LA to Chicago to Miami direct we weren't able to do that before so having that accessibility and now the the transportability to be able to do these things it's an industry that sort of ripe for production maybe the last thing I'll say about this is there was this sort of notion years ago in the Bay Area and just in popular markets where VC was present that VCS would never invest someplace where they couldn't get to within two or three hours by plane right but now that Oklahoma's on the map and a lot of other similar size cities are on the map all that's changing right plus of course our proximity to to Dallas Austin Kanas City like the middle of country obviously as capable as as the coast as well right yeah absolutely but we also have a little bit different attitude here I feel like uh whether it's just running a business or working business and Venture Capital Partnerships a different sort of outlook on how to be successful in the midwest than kind of East Coast sort of you know portfolio building and looking for unicorns sure do do you see it the same way I think Founders here are uh used to doing more with less m and some people were talking I was talking to someone recently about this as being a pro and a con the pro is they're able to get meaningful traction with a smaller team with less money maybe they have some customers uh I think the downside is when it comes to getting that later stage Capital to invest in their business one you have to think about customers outside of your local and then two you have to think about who's going to finance your growth grow that's one of the things I've always been a proponent of is as our ecosystem grows and our companies start to show traction one the early stage investors like me and others can get them to that first meaningful inflection point but you're going to need the larger investors that can invest five or 20 million into these companies to really help them expand and again that mentality of I'm going to do it by myself and Grassroots and no uh large overhead and low use of Leverage all the different things I think that's great as a concept but really to grow like the next paycom you have to be willing to accept capital from from other places right now you mentioned that your focus is early stage so for those anyone listening who doesn't quite understand what that means kind of explain early stage investing generally when a company is getting going they are bucketed into this part of the the sort of economic cycle of hey you're just getting going you're you have some paying customers and you have a small team but if there's a significant variation in the market with the economy or something or your customer based changes you're still at risk of like going out of business because you're not very well capitalized so everything really at this point depends on your the levels of your working capital and your access to Capital so that's the early stage and these companies are very vulnerable you know the management team is not making much money most of what they have is in equity and they're getting to a point to where they're trying to create some sort of intrinsic value which for them is a a good customer base and having achieved uh the elements of what is the product Market fit so so that's the early stage this is where we invested and our idea as Venture capitalists is to invest in enough of these companies such that at the end of our 10-year fund four or five of them have amazing outcomes because the other 20 might uh fall fall to these issues that happen to these early stage companies so that's the early stage so the the the growth stage or the companies in the middle like the seed stage is when they've achieved all getting R rid of some of those risks and now they're looking for Capital to help them expand their team help them expand their their technology and then the series stage or where later stage investors come in the door is helping them to form a a formal board to scale their operations to open up offices around the country all those that expansion build out the sea Suite you're not doing that when you're at the early stage and then ultim then beyond there it's just more and more of that until you have an exit and of course there's Angel and startup that's even earlier than that but that that's not a space that you guys actively participate in no we so Angel and like the startup and the friends and family rounds those are absolutely critical stages of the business but typically those stages occur or can occur when there's like zero Revenue the product may not even be welldeveloped there may not even be a team it's more so I have this idea I need some Capital to test whether or not my hypothesis is correct huge huge risk involved uh and lots of variables that are hard to control yeah and you know those risks are uh ones where the people investing you are really banking on who the founder is right and that's okay I I think that this type of in industry is based upon risk when people invest in Venture Capital they're looking for beta because they have Alpha somewhere else whether that's in the stock market whether it's in real estate more stable assets maybe they own their own business so I think they're okay with that no entrepreneur should ever feel bad about losing air quote someone's money if their business doesn't work out the investors already know that it may not so take the risk of course we're assuming that they have put the extra effort in they following best practices yeah they're doing everything right because they're in Partnership so they're they're already being observed in that way right are there particular verticals that you guys like to invest in and ones that you avoid this is a good question and I feel like my role as a venture capitalist is to add value Beyond just writing a check absolutely I preached that so much about Venture people all the time are like hey can you help me with with meeting a VC I need money it's like it's not enough to need money you need you need what they bring to the relationship because it's a long-term relationship yeah these companies that we invest in will be invested in them for probably more than seven or eight years so we have to be able to do more than that not only that we want to stay relevant for more than that time frame meaning we only we we're investing at this period if they're going to be successful there's going to be bigger investors that come in the door to try to take our position so it has to be more than just Capital so in regard to how we add value or what sectors we focus on we focus on sectors where we actually have experience the first eight years of my career were in financial services so naturally I look at a lot of financial services companies fintech companies have a guy on the team who works with a lot of SAS companies because that was his background and then a third guy on the team who does a lot of work with like BTO C companies so we can cover the gamut but categorically it's fintech B2B SAS and some b2c or like Commerce enablement companies these are broad categories but within them the mediums of what each company does is a little bit different but functionally it's like the same thing for example I just got off a call before coming in here with a fintech Founder who was talking about compliance and kyc and all these different AML things that Banks and finance finial Services providers need in order to operate well because I worked at the Federal Reserve Bank I can speak to the Dynamics of what that actually means and what they need and how to develop that so I'm adding value I have no expertise in life sciences so I wouldn't tell a life science founder to do anything right because that's just not my expertise but you know how to get get a hold of experts if you need to absolutely and you know we built a a a a group within Sak Ventures called the Sak Ventures Guild it's 10 people who have expertise in different things and on a quarterly basis we ask our existing portfolio companies and potential portfolio companies to present their company to the entire guild via Zoom tell them what they need and each person on the the call has the opportunity to help that founder with whatever they're looking for right you're also a Tech Stars Mentor I am so that's that's part of this whole process too right is mentoring giving back you know just kind of helping everyone else along which is that Rising tide that lifts all boats yeah yeah Tech Stars has been great I I have uh I'm work working with a fintech Founder now who's building a lending company her name is um the company's called catapult and they're helping CP great name I like that yeah it's a company that's helping cpg Brands to get access to cap working capital to fund their buses a lot of times these cpgs get these massive purchase orders from large retailers but they can't fulfill they can't fulfill it yeah so her company bridges that Gap it's been interesting to work with her on a at first it was a weekly basis now we meet on a bi-weekly basis to talk through the operational challenges the go to market strategy we have good meetings and sometimes we have frustrating meetings but it's uh I I feel like I'm working inside her company and not literally because they're doing all the work but more so providing the insight and the guidance I like doing that the difficulty in that it's very hard to scale so we can't do that with every single company sure so the guild is important having other team members is important and relying on your network is important as well and organizations that extend your uh Network like like ovf like ovf as well right organizations like them there's even now these companies that are forming where they they'll call you a VC or company and say hey we have a group of experts that charge X number of dollars per hour okay if you'd like to hire any of them to work with any of your startups you can do that too I get a ton of those calls I bet you do but I think it's one of the things where VCS are trying to or people are trying to figure out how to scale VC and add value and they know that as VCS we can't do that for every single company right now Tech Stars is in Tulsa techar is in Tulsa y you're based here in Oklahoma City Y are are you invested in in businesses in in both of those Metro areas we so we just started in deploying capital in technically in the first quarter of this year because Sak's a relatively new company I started sarak or Sak in January of last year took the first three months of the year to get the infrastructure built and then spent the remainder of the Year looking for an anchor investor so we did that had our first close in March of this year and now have started formally deploying capital and have a really good pipeline we have a number of companies that were looking at some in Tulsa some here in Oklahoma City uh the first few Investments that we made were based upon companies that had known and have been working with prior to my starting the company those companies are not based here but like I said to someone else today we are an open door we want to talk to as many Founders that we think fit within our strategy as possible regardless of where they are but the fact that we're based here in Oklahoma makes the ones here a lot more accessible to us sure but you mentioned earlier the fact that business can be done nationally internationally because of Technology things like that you even mentioned remote work you know Tulsa has a really successful remote work program that is attracting a lot of of talent to Tulsa what what do you what do you think what do you think of that program and how do you think that that effect is going to benefit not just Tulsa but the whole state of Oklahoma probably the Midwest I wish we had that here in Oklahoma City I do too I mean we need a person or organization to step up and do something like that because I think it's been so good for Tulsa and I the follow on the St statistics from that have been I think like 80 or 60 or 70% of the people who have come to Tulsa for that program have stayed after their required time period I think it's a great program because with so many jobs going virtual it's so much easier for them to sort of live where they want and make really good salary like liveing Tulsa lower cost of living as opposed to Boston or San Francisco or New York or even Austin I do Wonder though Kyle if as some of these tech companies and others who were huge proponents of virtual work and requesting that people come back into the office could that impact negatively Tulsa remote and other programs like that I don't know right but I think that anyone could argue that it's been a great program I wish we had it in Oklahoma City I completely agree too yeah now something we do have in Oklahoma City because it's Statewide and you have a lot of experience with ie you you used to work at i2e so what's what's your take on how the state putting kind of their money where their mouth was back in the day to to to form ite now of course they have ples Ventures that's that's doing their fun how do you think now that that that that ripple effect has happened do how much success do are we seeing at VC in 2024 comes from the fact that it has been around for 20 something years now I would equate i2e in the same way as I would I forgot what that company was called that was the first tech company to receive money from the government in Silicon Valley that effectively started Silicon Valley but it was a group of researchers who you know after World War II they decided to start a tech company with a ton of funding from the government to build Technologies and that was the Genesis of that man if someone REM remembers that the name of that company as a tech person I should know this uh but I is that without ite nothing would exist and having worked there before I know that the state was incrementally reducing the amount of capital that they were giving to IE but they still made it work and PLS Ventures uh is a testament to that started with Oklahoma Angel fund one which I created Oklahoma Angel fund two and then obviously planes and now there's a large uh a larger platform of funds that they manage and I'm on I'm a board adviser at i2e management and I have a tremendous amount of respect for the organization I consider them family yeah I there's a huge amount of awesome people over there doing amazing things uh just attended the L's cup award ceremony earlier this week and uh that's another uh application of what they're doing by getting young people in college to to think about entrepreneurism starting businesses and of course hopefully keep those businesses here so what the work doing I'm with you I have so much respect for the work they're doing and the people that are involved what was it like working going to work for ite like coming from banking from being you know being something that was more on the traditional side to something more now on Avenger Capital side obviously you it stuck with you because you're still in VC I decided I wanted to get into V to VC in 2006 I'd wrote down my goals I wanted to do this I wasn't sure how and obviously I went from engineering to work at Northwestern Mutual to work at Morgan Stanley then I went to the fed and when I went to the FED I thought to myself man this is so far off from what I want to be doing that how I I get in the Venture from there cuz you know a lot of people would think maybe working at the FED is like would be the the the job right and my job there I was an examiner we would go into Banks and we would look at the loans that these Banks were giving out to make sure they were kosher and I hated that job at first but after a while I started to recognize that all this is is a deployment of capital and the bank has to validate these businesses so every single business that I looked at I learned something of like how they made money how they operated all these different things and it became almost like a Consulting thing where you're trying to understand the deployment of capital and doesn't make sense and that transferability of that skill set tremendously helped me when I started doing that with private companies because most of the time banks are giving money to private companies so not only that but then the analytical rigor that came along with that was certainly helpful right Scott meum was running ite at the time it just so happens that he and his I think his family owns a bank so when he saw my background he was like Okay Kevin come over here yeah because that's his background right for his family well he's an attorney was a state treasurer he knows numbers Etc Scott's great hope he's enjoying his retirement so you know speaking of background just growing up like uh where did you grow up and what kind of what kind of kid were you very curious I grew up in Tulsa a very curious kid and sometimes that Curiosity was productive and sometimes it wasn't uh I I don't tell a lot of people this but now I'm pretty open about it but I have a very non-traditional path into Venture professionally but I think a very non-traditional path in general I grew up in Tulsa uh when I was one or two or three my parents moved to Claremore Oklahoma okay my dad was working at a factory there and he was involved with a church my parents split when I was five or six I was in kindergarten and it was tough at that point my mother moved back to Tulsa my father lost his job we were homeless for a couple of years living in this small little shed on the side of our friend's house there was no running water in there no bathroom it was tough and I was in M I was in elementary school walking back and forth to school and sort of dealing with the shame of living in that type of situation then we moved back to the Tulsa area in these sort of projects if you want to call it and those were probably the toughest years of my life like I did not envy my childhood and most people who were in those situations didn't turn out like I did right so now that overcome all those obstacles and arrive to where I'm at today with like beautiful wife and two kids and you know just like a normal life I always say you never judge a book by its cover but all the difficulties I experienced sort of made me who I am today and I I think about that quite a bit in regard to even the name of sarak Ventures SARS are these large ice formations that form at the tops of the highest mountains in the world oh and if you're a mountaineer trying to get to the summit you got to over you got to navigate through these things and they put a lot of people down they're very difficult so our thought was we want to work with Founders and work with people who are okay with navigate or fighting through these obstacles that they might encounter in Life or in their business because they're just trying to get to the top and we want to help them do that that's sort of our Mantra guiding Founders to the top so for me I can relate to that I love just understanding the story of each founder that we're talking with because I want to understand is this the type of person that will run through a brick wall to be successful cuz I had to do that and most successful people do I I I like the story behind sarak I I I didn't realize what that was I learned a term today and I like that as far as your branding Pro process there uh you also mentioned you know not judging a book by a cover let's talk about your book okay cool yeah you know to tell everyone about your book starting your own Venture investment fund when I was at IE we were heavily dependent on the state of Oklahoma's dollars but to deploy that Capital we had to have 50% match from private investors hence the reason why IE started seed step Angels which was a group of private Angel Investors so I said to Scott meum we should raise our own private fund that way we don't have to go out and sort of her cats to get that other 50% of capital we can just have that inhouse so I took about 18 months to get that going myself and Mark linger we went out into the market and talked to investors for that first fund we raised it was like sub2 million dollar but it was a concept to figure out if this could work that process of trying to get all of that going was so difficult because there was like no one wanted to share information information was hard to come by this was back in 2017 or 18 and I thought surely there are other people who want to understand how you do this so I just wrote a book about it it was my contribution to the Venture Capital industry of just my Inside Story and the how-to of how to do it at the time I had just started like blogging and I wasn't doing it for any sort of fame or recognition I just thought I've always wanted to be a net contributor to the industry and not be someone that was just taking taking taking so the book my blog things like that were just my way of giving back Well turns out so many people have read that book and thank you for writing this and wrote it deliberately to be short and to the point people have contacted me from all over the world about that book and for me anyone who contacts me and says hey I'd love to talk about how you did that I'm more than game because it was so hard to do that's so cool you also one of the ways you give back you're a very active contributor on LinkedIn you post a lot but you answer a lot of questions too i' mentioned a couple people who are coming on the podcast they say ah I I get so much out of his content on LinkedIn I am a big believer that if you're going to talk about something publicly it should be beneficial to the masses yeah one of the things I don't like about social media and even LinkedIn is when it's just a bunch of like look at me I did this I went to this conference this I took this picture I'm like what does that do for me right so my mentality is if I'm going to post it's going to be something of value something where I put some thought into it something to where yes I want my stamp on that I think everybody should do that I I agree totally but not everybody does so you can now understand why I absolutely wanted you on the podcast uh because you bring so much knowledge insight and and perspective to not just business but venture capital and and funding for business attitude about how to go about things be successful how to how to get through the Sak and make it to the top of the mountain did I do that right so I appreciate you being on podcast I've interview viwed you before for the Oklahoma Venture Forum podcast so I'm now I'm excited that got you on the podcast here uh looking forward to seeing how people react and see maybe what kind of social media interaction we get when we post this episode perfect so appreciate it today we've been talking with Kevin Moore he is a founder of sarak Ventures which is a GP he a general partner there he is a background in finance and all types of things that go around business and he is someone who has made it to the top of the mountain despite that sck trying to hold him back appreciate you being

He demystifies launching your own fund with his book, Starting with Your Own Venture Investment Fund, a how-to guide. Sharing his insider knowledge on fundraising and investment strategies. With a background in finance and a passion for startups, more empowers the next generation of venture capitalists. We're very excited to have you here today. Man, I'm excited to talk with you because not only are you fantastic in this space, but you also written a book and we're going to break into that book today because we want to figure out all these great nuggets that you've learned, but tie that right back into how the startup world works because all this material really does align so nicely to how a startup should be looking at raising funds and how they should be operating. But before we get into that, Kevin, I'm going to turn it over to you. one thing about you that nobody would know and maybe you can start with a bit of your background all the way from the days of Oklahoma State. Perfect. Thank you for so much for letting me be here. It's a pleasure. Um maybe I'll just give a brief intro on my background. Um I feel like I'm a very non-traditional venture capitalist because I got my degree in civil engineering. I live in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, right here in the middle of the United States. But I've been blessed with opportunities to do this wonderful job and to back a lot of different companies. And you know, I started out with this curiosity as a kid of entrepreneurship and what it meant. My first sort of experience selling things to try to make money was gathering items from around our house and putting them on our front yard to have a little garage sale. I was probably in the second or third grade when I did that. Uh, we also had an opportunity to sell candy when I was in high school. We got candy and sold lollipops and Snickers bars to people throughout the school just to make a little bit of money. I remember when I graduated college and moved to Chicago, I started a t-shirt company called Urban Necessity and we were selling urban clothing and artwork and all these different things, but just whatever you could do on the side to sort of scratch that itch. I graduated, moved to Chicago, was working as an engineer for a couple of years, knew this wasn't what I wasn't supposed to be doing, and then I graduated into or moved into financial services, thinking that this would be the launch pad for learning more and getting into venture capital eventually. So I did that for a few years, worked in financial services for six year, eight actually eight years and then moved into venture capital where I've worked now both on the GP side as a GP investing in early stage companies and on the LP side investing into funds and now running Sarak Ventures my own firm taking all those learnings and doing what I'm doing now. So it's been a long journey but a fun one. Uh, that's a great story and I was smiling because I I literally was sharing this story a few days ago where um was sharing about when I was a kid, my parents told me that I took all of my sandbox toys and went down to the beach and sold them all at the flea market. So um when you were saying you were selling stuff around the house, apparently I was doing the same thing. So I thought there was an opportunity there to help, so I better go and make some money. Um, and uh I was very uh I guess it's um uh can't remember what the term would be called, but thrifty. So, uh that's how I bought my parents' birthday gifts was uh to retake uh my toys, sell them, and then maybe find something and rewrap that and give them it as a gift. So, I guess our entrepreneurial spirit started really young. We were enterprising young chaps. We totally were. I love it. Uh, I'm sure there's other stories along the way that you you kind of start to think about like, I did this. Yeah. And it it becomes more entertaining than anything because you don't even realize you're doing it, but you're like, I just needed a few bucks to do X and whatever that X was, it made it interesting. But I can only imagine in your t-shirt business if you would have kept it going. Who knows, today that could have been uh one of the largest urban t-shirt companies in Oklahoma or in Chicago area. Who knows? But it's funny how we don't always keep behind the drive of things that we're passionate for. We use them as a vehicle for the timing and then we kind of keep moving on. My wife and I talk about this all the time because it was our first year, our second full year of marriage and we were both sort of just we had a lot of free time and this was at a time and not to date myself when e-commerce and online shopping wasn't really that big of a deal but literally not too long after that it just exploded and it seemed to be the preferred way for people to get things but you know everything has its time and its place. It's just a learning experience. But I think the underlying thing that we're discussing here is the desire to do something independently and venture capital and entrepreneurship and everything that people talk about on the show and what we see every day JP is is that and that is fun in of itself. I totally agree with that. And you know, you have to start somewhere. And the cool thing is is that your experiences and my experiences are you know something really small, something gritty. You just went out and tried it to see what the outcome would be. uh you got the the the niche for it because now you figured out I can make money if I just try and do something and it doesn't matter if it comes easily. It's just the fact that I have the switch that I can turn on and I can figure out how to balance things out when I need to. And I think when you kind of take back to some of your experience in uh the space that you worked in, what I liked about it is that one you have that entrepreneurial side and then you moved into the fin engineer to finance and finance. I think this is probably something where almost it should be mandated across all education, school and everywhere is that you somehow have to take a couple years of how finance works. I think it's the most daunting scariest thing to most. Um but you spent a good eight years working in finance. Is there something there that you could say, you know, I took these learnings and they've really impacted how I work with founders, how I work with people. Um, and is it that every founder you work with is just gang busters for numbers, or it's the complete opposite and you tend to be pushing them more on how to uh report and share back information to uh to other GPS and LPS and their and their investments? I like this question because the engineering side of me made it such that I was very comfortable working with numbers. So the financial side of it didn't bother me. What I learned probably the most working in financial services was how to work with people. And the best and easiest way into finance is if you're able and comfortable with selling. So that was something that was completely new to me thinking about transitioning out of engineering into a role where it wasn't just about numbers. It was about people and the ability to develop relationships. And a lot of that has to do with business development. So whenever I left the engineering job and went to work in finance, that first role that I took was 100% commission and I was selling a combination of insurance and investments. And one of the things that they taught us was about the statistics behind how you actually built a business which were your clients and just following the numbers and having the discipline to do that on a daily basis like without without uh without excuses and that was really a that was a challenge and for a while there I was getting into the office at 5:30 in the morning sitting at my desk just putting together and planning the day and figuring out how am I going to get this activity done. But it was it literally was just no skill, just straight up discipline and hard work. And you're learning all the other things on the side about like how to invest and put together portfolios. But I think as it relates to venture capital as a GP and as GPS, we are selling ourselves to investors. We're selling ourselves to founders and there's different numbers that go along with that to to ensure success. We are also uh I also think that understanding the financial component of the industry at large is you understand and see that they're intrinsically related. The public markets and the private markets they all play together. And I don't think that I would have fully understood that had I not worked in financial services. I probably could have read it in a book somewhere, but having that experience of seeing a company go public and selling that and investors getting liquidity and portfolio construction, these are all sort of just ideas and frameworks that can be applied to whatever medium within sort of different industries, private equity, venture capital, hedge funds, whatever that you kind of get familiar with and you start to implement when you have to do it when you're building something like a venture capital firm for yourself. So I could talk a lot more about that cuz it is it is interesting and I am very thankful for that experience. I love it because you you actually took a different angle on how the financial space benefited you than what I would have expected you to say like, \"Hey, being in finance, I learned about finance. I learned about those things, but you were already comfortable. You were already working in that mix. So, you actually honed in on skills that, as you mentioned, you didn't have fully baked in, which was how do I communicate with people? How do I work with people? And then how do I build a framework so that I can sell because right now I'm working commission. And I love this because you literally took something that you already knew, stepped into a space that you weren't comfortable with, and you got thrown into the call it into the den because you literally had to learn everything all in one shot. You're like, I already know finance, but I don't know how to sell. I don't know how to sell in this type of environment, and if I don't sell, I don't get paid, and I don't make any money, and this isn't going to be worth it to anybody. Um, and you're obviously going newly married, you're going through all these things, you've got a lot more costs and things that you have to step up to to make sure you can manage. So, I just love the fact that you took a different approach to it and said, \"I had to learn way different skills.\" And in that those learning those skills are kind of what actually helped you move forward. And the biggest one it sounds like is you learned how to work within frameworks, which is putting together a process that was simple and clean. And the reason why I'm bringing this up is because when I was reading your book, which was fantastic, by the way. Um, it's short and sweet, but it literally is a framework. Like, you literally walk through it. And, you know, I'm going to give you some more uh uh pumps here, but the other thing I loved about it is that at the end of each chapter, you had actionable items. I think every book should have that. like it's almost like a little synopsis of here's what you just read in case you forgot everything that you just read and here's a couple of points that are really going to stand out and start taking notes and make some action items here because this is how you're going to move forward. So I just love the fact that everything rounded out each time. So you built a framework on how you walk through each process to get to raising money. You walk through each process on how you are going to close a deal in your working in finance. So I just love that because the framework is what makes this work. If you have no framework, you'll just go in circles. Yeah, absolutely. And I think that just going back to something you said earlier around I felt like the book skills anybody can learn. You can learn those things and I was interested in them and started to learn them before I even got into the business. But I think the art of the business is our ability to break down complicated things in ways that normal people can understand them. whether it's a founder, whether it's an investor, whether it's anybody. And I think that if you understand kind of the the process of solving problems like most people, especially in my previous life as an engineer, that's what we were taught to do. And processes and things of that sort were we followed those because we understood that it's the framework that sort of drives the outcome, not the other way around. And just to emphasize that even more, there are design principles. There are invest investment principles that apply. And if you can structure that in a way that it makes sense, it can be applied to anything. And I think this is one of the reasons why when I was working on the GP side and I went to work on the LP side, investing at a fund of funds, the medium to me was it didn't really matter. It was the process of evaluating an opportunity, putting together a portfolio, understanding and doing the diligence, understanding who the stakeholders are, who's interested in investing in that strategy. Ultimately, my interests are investing into early stage companies. But having that perspective of seeing that side of the business has been tremendously beneficial as a GP. But again as an investor I think that that concept can be applied to anything whether it's real estate whether it's investing in the public markets etc etc so frameworks are a really big thing to me and it it shows and I and I like I said I really enjoyed walking through the framework and as an engineer my brain was like maybe it was that piece it was like ah it's just it's so it's so nicely divided and easy to work through so I loved it um you know and you know kind of shifting from the finance space and as you moved into LPGP angel space um you know just to dive into the book a bit more uh you know there was um a couple of concepts say in each area that I want to just touch briefly on because I think it really relates to how startups operate. So like you could take your book and change everything from how to build a fund to how to build a startup and it would be the exact same thing. So I only take 10% royalty on that change over of your book. So basically the concept um the concept that I liked was at the beginning you talked about a thesis and you said come up with a thesis. Well for me from a startup perspective this is come up with your hypothesis on the problem you're trying to solve which is identical to what that thesis is. And what I loved about your thesis, and I'm not sure if you um had gone back and looked at this, is that you created three ones, three thesis that you shared. This is what a thesis should look like. And they were so accurate. They were brilliant. They were perfect. So like cut and dry. You could not scurry around it. That's the whole point of a thesis is that it's supposed to take away all the fluff and just get you to the point. Um, Bitcoin usage will become ubiquitous, eliminating the need for cash for purchasing products. Period. Add in some other words, but give or take. This is what you share. And it's perfect because it literally says, \"My hypothesis is this, and I'm going to go after this because this what I think is going to change the world.\" And then you focus on that. Maybe there's going to be pre and post comments that will circle around that thesis, but maybe you can talk a little bit about um some of the learnings that you had from when you really refining this thesis because it's like refining your hypothesis of your business. It's like one problem, one solution. And how do founders get their head around that better? Because you just showed that you can do that. and look today where Bitcoin is. He wrote this in 2000, I'm gonna assume between 2016 and 2018 launch. And at that point, people probably didn't even know what Bitcoin was to to the point that they do today. And look how relevant that is getting because of that thesis. And if everything was invested in that category, you know, would you have been a leader in that category for that comment? So, it's pretty fascinating on how you derived this and then the outcome. Um, and you added in a few elements like avoid large funds and you came up with some elements that help you better focus this thesis. Can you share a little bit about why this is so crucial to a founder when they're building their company? I think that whenever I'm talking with a founder, their thesis to me is important certainly, but what's more important is their why behind it. And whenever you're looking at a market opportunity, I want to understand how did you derive and come to that conclusion that that was going to be a profitable or will be a profitable sort of opportunity for you? And their ability to explain that reinforces their thesis. If the thesis is we're going to be living on the moon in five years because the planet Earth is going to be destroyed by climate change. Okay. Well, that's a great thesis, but tell me why you think that's going to happen and the justification behind that is kind of more important than what the thesis is in general. But I think that it's just fundamental to when you're asking somebody for money, Mr. or Mrs. founder, having that thesis support is critically important. And I'm not a scientist, but again, back to the engineering days, we did have to justify mathematically and through our formulas, if you will, how that worked. And the formula for a founder might be their business model or their target market or their industry expertise or whatever it might be. It just so happens by happen stance that I've been studying Bitcoin. I own Bitcoin. our fund doesn't really invest in sort of Bitcoin as it right now, but my thesis was I felt like that would be something that would be um useful in the future, mainly more of the decentralization side of that. But I think those were just examples of things I was thinking at the time when I wrote the book that I was sort of thinking about. And look, your thesis could be wrong and there's no certainty that it's going to happen. But more importantly is a structure of like how did you develop that? In fact, as as we were talking before the the blog uh podcast, I was writing a blog about portfolio construction, which I'm going to post later today. And it wasn't so much that there's a wrong or right way to structure a venture capital portfolio or a wrong or right way to run a company, Mr. or Mrs. Founder. It's just like what is the reasoning and the basis behind it? To me, that's what matters and that's what gives an investor confidence to invest in you when you're talking to them about your company. No, that's that's gold. I I I think it helps you align your brain to, as you mentioned, the why, but the justification to the point of what that thesis is. So if you can justify it and everybody else can believe in the way you've justified it, then people will want to invest because they will also believe the world is flat or the world is going to blow up in the next 5 years because you've created such an argument that it's almost inevitable that this will happen. Regardless if it does, you've created enough backdrop information, justified it, and you're proving your thesis. And regardless, you'll be the best at that category or that thesis and drive out as many businesses that will help sustain and fulfill that gap until you get to that five years and decide, okay, I built something great. Maybe the earth isn't going to go that way, but we've invented some great companies and we've got a lot of great companies in our portfolio. So now you kind of take that rounding side of things and you say, well, now that we started and we start to have these companies, we're investing in them. you know you go into metrics and the metrics can be kind of opened up to many things but I think this is where the shortcomings of founders are is maybe it's on the numbers side maybe it's the understanding side but you talk about things like well how do I know you can prove to me that this is going to work so you've got things from DPI to deal flow um how you're going to invest types of founders so is there a criteria that you look at today and did it shift from 10 years ago because your learning's changed. So, is it growing as well? Are you refining your process and saying, \"No, I don't like these founders. They keep failing.\" Nope. These ones keep being fraud. So, I'm not looking for the uh the blonde hair brush cut guys anymore. They're not doing it. So, I'm going after the med school uh PhDs. like have you kind of continued to refine your KPIs and your metrics just as a founder should when they're out pitching for for money or for pitching in general? For sure. One of the things that I think is important as an investor is to certainly you want to be in line with whatever trend is happening but more than a trend more sustainable trend. One of the things that we think about at Sarra Ventures is investing in areas or into products or services that are going to always be in some sort of demand. And there's innovation that happens within those specific categories. For example, we believe that no matter what happens in our society, people are going to need access to financial services. There's going to be different tools and technologies that persist within those industries. But money makes the world go around and it's always going to be there. There's no fear in my mind that the fintech industry is going to fail and not be relevant. That's just in my opinion not going to happen. We don't invest in medicine, but I'm just giving another example. People are always going to have issues with their health. It is always going to happen. So that category is always going to be there. However, bads change. So we're not investing in things that are temporary. So just as this relates to a founder, perhaps there's a period or window of time when things are more relevant than others. And you can look back in history across technology and see that happen. But also there's the opportunity to, you know, not overthink things and create new categories that didn't exist before. And one of the things that I was reading in a book recently or maybe listening somewhere about how there's been some revolutionary founders who've created categories of technologies and products that there was no sort of what might this be but they created new categories. When you think about Henry Ford for example, Henry Ford created or sort of industrialized the automobile. But at that time there was no infrastructure to support that. There were no like gas stations all over the country, service stations, how are you going to get fuel to different places? All of that stuff had to be created that infrastructure for all those different things. But the automobile fundamentally changed the way that we uh track travel, logistics, everything. So you don't have to figure out everything. But that's a new category defining technology. So there's we have to be careful not to sort of pigeon hole into places where you know there's all this certainty, but to be sort of optimistic and forward thinking about the things that are to come. I think AI is probably one of those as well. And that's another deep you we could do a podcast just on that topic. But again, I think I'm getting the point across here. No, agreed. And and I think when you start to figure out what that fat is, it's like a bad shirt versus, you know, it looks great today, but it's not going to look very good in a week or two once you've kind of got used to the bad colors or whatever it is. So, it's the same idea. It's trying to figure out where that's going to take us and can will someone buy this and will it be a staple product in the next 5 years and will it be again in the 10 years from now or will that innovation go a step further. So you'll be obsolete in 5 years or 10 years because the technology is going to get picked up on and it's going to be even uh different where there won't be vehicles anymore. It's just going to be flying and it's going to happen that fast. Um and I see like uh Zutterberg came out the other day saying that we're we're too attached to our mobile phones but in 5 years we won't be even using phones. it'll be everywhere we go. We're going to pick up on glass and the glass is going to tell us who we are and what we need to see and only we'll be able to see it. So that there's going to be this shift that they're now trying to put out there because they want people to start believing that ah my mobile phone ah I don't like it and then all of a sudden this new tech's going to come out it'll be Google Glass or whatever metaglass but the whole idea is I have to start feeding the brain today so that you start to believe it so that in the next 5 years you'll want to remove this phone because it's nothing but cumbersome. So they'll start to sell that through so they can have a new category and open up the door for something bigger. So you know you start to tie in these facets of um sales techniques um how you get the deal flow, how you as a startup is going to generate and make this a business. And then some of the other things you touch on which again I think this is something that's got to be like stamped everywhere is you talk about accounting, legal and reporting. And from a venture side, that's really crucial so that your investors better understand what they're buying into, what they get. It's regulated. It happens every quarter. They're getting the information they need. But how come that doesn't transfer down to the startups? What is the fear of a startup sharing this information to their investors? Um, do you have any ways that you work with founders to get them to be more alerted to the fact that this will benefit them to share out um and get this off their chest and do it on a regular basis? uh you know it it seems to be like I said when you went into the deep dive in the book it's like that aha totally agree I I'd like every founder to believe this but where's the shortcomings on this I certainly think that founders don't have to be experts at all those different things but I think that as a CEO of a company you should have some sort of awareness of how those things work one of the things that technology has helped and also accelerated is the number of companies that are in the market where there are so many opportunities now to use experts at discounted prices to help founders set up these structural elements of their company such that they don't have to do that themselves and they can focus on the things that really drive the business. However, it's important to understand how to read a financial statement, what legal entity documents are important, how to lead a team meeting, and how to motivate and lead your employees, like just basic things. There are a lot of technical founders and some people who are really good at just their product or their service or they're really good at sales. And as companies mature, and we've both seen this, sometimes that person who started the company might stay in that role and you bring in someone with that skill set who understands all the different elements of a business. When you look at large Fortune 500s or just larger companies, often time the CEO is someone who was the COO. And the COO typically understands and has their hands in every single functional operating part of the company. When I think about that at a venture capital firm, the structural elements of like how people elevate within a firm, they usually start out looking at deals and they start out partnering in partnering and like investing in the deals or maybe they start out as an analyst and they're doing all different things within a company or you might have someone who was a chief of staff or an IR person who understood a certain part of the business now they're helping with investments. But I feel like as a GP, we can either a outsource all of that or b just have a general understanding of it so we know what we're getting. And as a founder, I think it's the same thing. One of the things I I wanted to also touch on in the book that I hope we don't leave out is the market validation piece. One of the things that I was taught starting out in financial services was trying to get an understanding of did I have enough market or people that I knew that would support me if I were to transition into this type of business. But a lot of that was I think a weeding out process. But it was more important to understand do I have a market to sell these products? And we do the same thing as VCs. I did the same thing in starting the first fund I ever started. I spent literally six months hardcore just talking to people about does this make sense? Here's the thesis. Here's what we're trying to do. Same thing with Sarak Ventures. I went out and talked to a bunch of people before figuring out should should I even launch this? And founders should do the same thing. They should spend time actually talking to their customers. Case study. Here's an example. I was working with a founder and I was talking to this founder about their product and some of the issues that I saw with it just in practicality the usage problems and I said you're spending a lot of time on this and you've actually raised money on it. Have you actually talked to the the end customer to figure out what they want? Like oh um I haven't actually done that yet. And I said, 'You haven't went literally went to their office, sat down with them and collected this data. And that was a huge red flag. But I think that we live in this society where people rely so much on the less face-to-face sort of information gathering. And I think you're missing something from that. Not that you can't get sufficient information, but the lack of investigation by some people is alarming. And when conducting due diligence, it's important to understand that not just for me to a founder, but also from an investor looking at Sarak Ventures or someone looking at your fund or whoever. So I think that the market validation piece is something that uh is pointed out in the book that is relevant regardless of the industry. No, I completely agree with that. They end up building for themselves and not for the problem. They they assume this problem. they're building for it, but they haven't built anybody in that really wants to try it or has an interest to solve the problem. And and maybe this falls a lot more on venture where or investors, angels or uh LPs that they have to do more investigation to ensure that this has merit and has value and that not everybody's bought into just the idea and the concept, but that there is some form of market validation uh versus it just being a hunch. And and I think to your point, there's a lot of hunches and people are just going with them because they all feel the same hunch, but they haven't investigated if someone would actually change an entire industry over to work off of this type of product or are they too early or are they too late? There's probably lots of different ways that that could structured into that. Yeah. And again, I always like to think, you know, not some of this stuff to me is just common sense. And I think founders even know this. It's just a function of knowing something and actually doing something. Like you have to go out and actually do it. And I'm so glad you said about solving a problem for yourself and or is this a problem for a greater magnitude of people. Such a good point. I think about that all the time. And one of the ways in conducting due diligence to figure that out is asking a founder, why did you start your company? And if their answer is something like, well, I wanted to go out on my own and build something for my family or I did I wanted to do this because I want to be independent. I don't want to have a boss. I'm like, that's the that's not a that's not that's your that's that's an answer, but it's not the right answer. The right answer is I saw this huge problem out there that needed to be fixed and I just couldn't I couldn't deal with myself if I didn't stop and try to fix this this massive problem. That is a better answer. At least it is for me, but it's indicative of like the why behind people's reason for starting a company. Agreed. And if you tie in the the earlier comment you made, they spent 6 months diving into it to prove that there was a real problem there versus um seeing it, then you've got the full solution that they did all the pre-work, they did everything they could and they're coming back to you and saying, \"Look, I know there's a market here. I've proven it. I went out. I hustled. I found the problem. I found the gap and my hypothesis was correct. There's a problem and here's my solution to the problem I came up with.\" You know, I was talking to a founder la me last week and probably one of the most impressive things I've ever heard. He said he conducted diligence on uh he had a problem that he thought he sent out uh interview requests to a thousand people ended up talking to roughly 150 of them identified and validated a problem and sold a solution and got customers. Then he went back and built the product. And I'm like, this is to me the best way to build a company is get a customer, then build the problem versus, you know, build a solution and then go out looking for customers. It just showed so much maturity and I wish more founders would do that. I love it. Agreed. Well, to kind of wrap up the the the structure of the book and all the great things that it kind of aligns you to and I will tell everybody you have to read this because it it's a great framework for either starting a company, starting a fund, but it really does help on all fronts. Um, you know, we kind of walk through market validation. You've got accounting, legal reporting, metrics, uh, thesis. And the last one that it kind of really touches is, um, two parts to it is expectations. And I think a lot of the time founders will say, well, we're going to do 10 million this year. And they haven't even started. Um, and and then they they have this grasp of these big things and they say, well, venture wants to see this. Yeah, sure. But what is its really possibilities? What is the real value? What have you tested to prove that you think you could actually do in numbers? So there's that side of it. What are the expectations? And then what are the roles that venture fits into helping companies, angels, LPs, venture people? What are their roles in helping these companies actually achieve these goals? Like where do you see that um the fit there? Because I think we all want to just be in there helping like crazy, but is that really going to validate and bring value to the founder and to their company or, you know, what's the recommendation? What's the best way for my money to be successful? Because I'm literally giving you money like I put in the stock market and I want it to be successful. I want it to make me 10x, 20x, but I really want to make sure there's some validation, but also that there's expectations are met or at least somewhat met. How do you kind of validate through all of that? I think as VCs the best thing that we can do for companies is use our experience to provide examples of what works and what doesn't work. We cannot go into every company and operate their company. Nor can we be expected to be experts at the things that they're super passionate about. I have a general understanding and sort of deep knowledge of the financial services industry even the regulatory side of that. So whenever I'm talking to fintech founders and companies that might have some sort of embedded finance component I'm able to talk to them about that consumer behaviors what's happening on the regulatory front. Does this make sense for customers? They benefit from that interaction but I can't operate their company. Nobody can do that. Anyone that says that they're doing that, that's unrealistic. I do think that VCs have the ability to provide structural support in areas like marketing. They can do things like recruiting. They can even introduce people to customers or even other investors. I think that what we spend the most time doing is introducing our portfolio companies to other VCs who might want to invest in them and then scouring our personal networks to introduce them to potential customers. We also have some advisors within our network that will work with our portfolio companies to give them different things. But at the end of the day, the founder has to run the business and they don't have to take our advice. We're just there as another resource. And realistically, we think of of ourselves as as valuable as like other VCs, meaning we're not the only investor in their company. So, we always take the position that we know that they're getting flooded with a lot of advice and other things. So, it's just more so acting as an advisor to the to the to the portfolio company, not trying to run their company, and then trusting them to make the right decision. I like that it's a simple approach, but it's there when they need it. It's uh it's an open vault when they choose to come back and get the information, which is super helpful. And I guess in a way, you're saying know your lane. Figure out what your lane is and how you're going to support those companies. Make sure that they know if it's recruiting or if it's uh advising help, whatever it is, but know your lane so that when they do have a problem, they know who to come with because they've learned that over time through how you've proceeded in your investment with them. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's um it's a fun fun job, I'll tell you, seeing all the different technologies and the ideas, but the biggest thing is just execution. And sometimes the plans work, sometimes they don't. But execution is is everything. I love it. That's a great way to kind of end this segment on execution because execution to your point earlier, the person that didn't test the market, their execution was limited. So in this case, execution wins the race. It's the best executors will move the product or fail it. And I've seen guys that uh gentleman that ran a company and he literally raised millions of dollars, went out to the market, was testing it, and said, you know what, this isn't working. I can't get anybody to take on it. So instead of spending more money and wasting the time, I'm going to fold the company and give everybody back what's left of the of the funding. And huge respect for that because they thought that there was a big problem there. They went after it and they couldn't solve it. So execution was everything in that case. Does that mean in 10 years from now it might be something bigger? For sure. But at least they stuck to their their uh drive and they tried to solve it and it wouldn't work. So instead of just burning out time for the next three, four years, wasting money and time, they decided to, you know, close it up and move on. And I think that that's also a respectful way of looking at um how you operate your you know your fidiciary responsibility is another way is uh to to give that back and walk away and try something different. Yeah, I respect that the maturity to be able to do that. That's huge. Agreed. Well, now we're going to jump just before we jump into the 60 spot. I have to ask this question because I'm a fan. So, is there a chapter? Is there a section of the book that you would move to the front, make it bigger, or is there a section you would say, you know what, I wish I put this in when I do version two of the book. I'm going to add in this new area because you've got eight, seven and eight years of learning from when you started writing to when you published to where you are today. Is there a section that you would add more to it or that you would put in a new chapter and say, you know what, I learned a lot about this. I'm going to do a whole subject just on governance and boards. Like, is there something that you would say you would add in? Because like I said, it's just that continuation of when you put something great out there that you can continue to layer onto it. I would say that for a fund manager, what I would I would add a chapter or a few chapters about the following, and I learned this from experience over time. the four elements of the four critical areas of of running a venture capital firm. That would be like the title of this entire section. It's fundraising, operations, general marketing for the firm, and then working with founders. those four categories. As a GP, you think or I guess most people on the outside think that all we do is work with founders, but in running a firm, we're thinking about all four of those areas all the time. Sometimes it's more heavy on fundraising. Sometimes it's more heavy on working with founders. Sometimes it's like you're doing a lot of marketing like going to conferences and podcasts and things of that sort. And then sometimes you're focusing on streamlining your internal operations. But all those different things have to be working together. And when I wrote that book, I had just raised that was my first fund. And I was so frustrated with the process of not understanding how to do it and piecing it together that I thought, oh, this could be a good resource for other people. But now having done that a few times, uh you understand in running a fund is no different than running a company. There are four functional areas. If you're a founder, your fundraising might be your for us, that's sort of our our source of of capital. It's the thing that we use to actually do business. For a founder, it might be their product. We have to have operations. So does a founder. We have to have marketing and visibility with customers. So does a founder. And then ultimately, we have to have a really good product. And founders to me are not products but they are the medium by which we attract our investors to the fund. And for individual company their product could be some new technology. So I think that from a I I would add to the book the business side of running a venture capital firm to fill that out. I just haven't had the energy to go back and add that in there. No, that's great. it like it you kind of uh you know if if I was s had to to add to your book I would add in the governance side but everything else to me was like a great homogeneous structure and if you added in that part you just talked about which is the fundamentals and the fundraising operations general and the the startup founder I I I think you just keep building on that you've got a fantastic um how-to book on again you could put founder on it and you could put investor on it and LP and everybody would have that same kind of general understanding of how this works and what that structure looks like. So I think it's great. So it's a great addition. Um and thank you for sharing that. So I think um next we'll jump into this 60-cond rant. So the way this works is you have 60 seconds. You'll rant about anything. I'll hit start and nobody has ever hit 60 seconds. So no pressure on that. Um and again it's to rant about anything. I will try and um disagree with your rant. never works because I'm always a big fan of the rents and I agree with them. So, I will share and then you can end it off. But, uh, when you're ready, 60 seconds, you're on. This is an easy one. One of the things that is a pet peeve of mine is when I hear any investor say that they knew that a particular company was going to be a huge success. There's absolutely no way you could know that. And if you knew it, you would put all of your resources into that one company. We are investors and as an investor the intelligent thing to do is to construct a portfolio and then manage your best companies but even then you still don't know which ones that's going to be. So when I see people taking credit for like these big massive wins, I think the credit should be like, you know, I didn't know that this company was going to end up like that, but I am pretty confident about our strategy as a firm to create the opportunity for that to happen. But there's no way that anybody could know. So that's just that's my rant. That's that's my one of my pet peeves. Well, I like it because you also came in at 60 seconds. So, bam, first person I think that's hit the hit the number right on. So, that's awesome. Um, I I will I won't counter it because I do agree with you wholeheartedly that it's feels like it's a game of luck. But now, if we take the way that you're and you talked about this earlier on the show is that you said portfolio construction. So when you're investing in the stock market, public markets, you've come up with, I want to be able to go into all these different areas. So telecom, rail, transportation, whatever it might be, AI, all of these areas, and that's the focus of of how you're going to generate over the next 10 years. So in a portfolio creation, when it comes to these big hits, it's one, you have to get into these companies at a certain point to be able to have that investment to say you got in there. So somehow you have to figure out how to get in there in the first place. And then secondarily, how it matches up because if you're only investing in AI companies and this happens to be a CPG company, then what are you doing in that as well? Because it seems that in earlier stage company portfolios, people want you to only invest in a specific segment. It's not that you can just invest in all companies everywhere because nobody can do everything great. So, how do you manage all of this? because I think it is a one-hit wonder to your point and you have to just take it as in honestly it's it's just luck because this isn't a stock market portfolio construction. This is literally a hit and miss and the risk is so high that the success is very low. But we'll take it as it comes. I guess that what what what I was writing about was how important portfolio construction is and I illustrate how you can actually invest in too few companies and you can have a strategy where you invest in too many. And what portfolio construction demonstrates is that you actually have a strategy for actually hitting or increasing the probability of hitting your desired returns. So again, it's highly debatable the number of companies that people should invest in or what sectors are going to drive that. But I think fundamentally it's just the framework for how you build a portfolio that matters to investors. And look, they ask about it. They ask about it deeply to make sure you understand it. So that was sort of I like to focus on that part of it versus saying that I know with 100% certainty that the this company is going to be the big winner. Agreed. And I like that you also threw in there that it's about the returns. The at the end result is I'm building a portfolio that's going to generate bigger returns than you would get if you went to the stock market. So you do have to figure out how you're offsetting the regular 8 to 12% uh increase on the TSX or the Venture or the NASDAQ etc. the Dow. So you have to prove how that's going to be possible through the investments, through the thesis and through the things you're investing in. So I agree it all comes back down to the fundamentals. You kind of have to take the lofty throw out there and uh the Hail Mary to toss because that's what you're going to win with. But you got to try and use the fundamentals that approve why this is going to be a profitable and valuable um portfolio. Absolutely. I love it. Well, we're almost there. We're going to jump into the rapid fire questions. So, the way this works is I will ask you a question. It's either and or just as the engineering side. Pick one or the other uh from your perspective as the investor. There are a couple of questions as well, so you can uh jump on those at the same time. Um all right, here we go. From your investment thesis and standpoint, would you rather invest in a founder or co-founder? Founder. Unicorn or a 4-year 10x exit? Fouryear. AI or blockchain? AI. First money in or series A? First money in. Board seat or observer? Observer. Safe for convertible note. Convertible note. Lead or follow? Lead. Two qualities for a to stand out to you. Discipline. Vision. verticals of focus in your fund. Fintech, SAS, future work. Love it. Number of companies invested per year. 8 to 10. Love it. Even more. Favorite part of investing? Watching companies progress and grow. that it's not the end outcome, it's the journey of seeing that happen. I like it. What is the piece of advice you give founders nine out of 10 times? Be willing to iterate. Do you have a philosophy or rules that you stand behind? Pretty much the same. Take the feedback, use it or not, but just be humble and willing to iterate because everyone wants the end goal to succeed. Who is your hero, mentor, and why? hero, mentor. It's probably people I've never met, but the first person that comes to mind is Steve Schwarzman, who started Black Rockck, I think that's his name. His story of hustle and grit and drive and determination, it's very motivating to me. I appreciate his book. I like it. What line do you find you share to investors over and over people who are investing into Sarak Ventures that there's opportunity everywhere and it's often found in places where people aren't looking. Like it. Now, this is a two-parter question. You don't have to use names, but choose what's best. What is your worst investment and your favorite investment or the same? I think the worst investment [Music] are founders who keep coming back to the pot for more money without a specific strategy on how how they're going to use that. I've seen that happen so many times and they never turned out well. The best investments are founders who try to maximize what they're doing on the least amount of money. Great advice. Uh do you have any references to podcasts or other areas that you collect information from that you think would be useful to founders or investors? I'm less of a listener and more of a reader. I read about two books a month. I try to read one book that's more like professional development and then another book that's about biographies about other people who started companies. There's so many good ones. Like I read Richard Branson's story, Steve Schwarzman's story, um Phil Knight at at at Nike. I've read all these different books and then I'll try to read a book about business. I think that if you think about your time of learning as one for personal growth and one for pe people you want to be like I think that's a good way to structure your like education. I love it the same. I love ripping through books. I'm a big fan. So I won't ask you what Oh, maybe I will. What's your favorite book? We'll go to the personal questions now. Favorite book, man. I still think that the best one of the best books I've ever read is Shoe Dog by Phil Knight. Um, you know, I also like Good to Great. It sat on my shelf for 10 years and I didn't read it thinking that I don't really care about this book, but then I finally read it. It was really one of those good one of those books. But then I'm reading I read another book recently called Buy Back Your Time by Dan Martell. Phenomenal book. Uh then I read uh is it Greg M Cohen who wrote essentialism phenomenal book um I mean I could I'm just looking at my bookshelf so many Richard Branson's book about how he built version and the multi- company approach super interesting but you learn from just reading the biographies of these people and there's some personal thing what's his name uh Glenn Sterns who he was on this show called undercover billionaire and he built a massive uh lending company that went through all the GFC and all those different things. Incred incredible story. I could go on and on. I love it. These are very valuable. I love it. Um big fan of I've read a few of those, but now I've got more to read, so I'm going to get on those, too. Um favorite sports team? Oklahoma City Thunder, obviously. Yeah, they are pretty pretty good. uh favorite movie and what character would you play? Man, it's maybe because of this recency bias. My favorite movie is uh Born Supremacy, the series. I've always had a undercover desire to work for the CIA in some sort of covert op. So, I'm really good at keeping secrets. I'm super disciplined and I can endure a lot of pain. We'll we'll cut this snippet off and send it over to the uh to the uh FBI or something and see if we can get you in there. I love it. I'm a big fan. I rewatched that about probably during co I remember rewatching the whole series. So, I agree. It's pretty sick. It's so good. Yeah. Uh cake or fortune cookie? Cake. Superman or Batman? Superman. DC or Marvel? Definitely Marvel. Come on. Well, you did pick Superman, so I know that's a little bit of a jump position. Yeah, that's our nerds coming out right now, but I'm just let it slide. Yeah. So, uh, football or football? Oh, definitely football. I like it. It's an international game. Come on. Agreed. Agreed. Elon Musk or Oprah Winfrey? Oprah because she's a pacifier and Elon's everywhere now. Like pretty soon he's going to be on the cereal box and he's going to be in my house hanging out. It's uh it's crazy how much uh this guy's moving around. Uh all right, Big Mac or Chicken McNuggets. McNuggets. I like it. All right, we're down to the wire. What is your superpower? uh my superpower like hidden talent things that people don't know about me you know when I was in college I used to cut hair and I did that as like a side business I learned I started doing it when I was 15 and just kept doing it and bought my wife's first wedding ring from my savings from that business I also speak fluent Spanish not a lot of people know that about me either I ah very cool study it every day. I think it's fun. I talk to people. I don't get to use it much in my work but I enjoy it and I wouldn't call it a superpower but it does take a lot of discipline to maintain it. Ah that's brilliant and and I'm glad that you brought that up so that we could end the segment with knowing your superpower but also knowing one thing about you that nobody would know. So that's brilliant. Um, and I'm gonna say Kevin, it's been an honor and a pleasure to not only get to know you and hang out with you in the Middle East, but to be sitting here today and and going through your book and going through everything about yourself and the way uh you look at things, I can say your superpower also on top of that is uh you're good with people and uh you're certainly sharp and uh you can share a lot of value. So, it's been a real pleasure getting to talk with you today and thank you for sharing to the audience. It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you so much JP. Well, the way we like to end our show is we leave you with the last word. So, anything that you want to share to the investors or to the startups, I I turn it over to you. Um, please share how people can get a hold of you. But again, thanks a lot for uh for joining. The easiest way to get a hold of me is on LinkedIn. I answer messages frequently on there or just submitting your information on the SRAK website if you're a founder. And maybe last word is ventures going through a cycle at the moment. And these cycles are important because they are rejuvenatory periods for the industry. And if you look back on history, these cycles are when you you find the most opportunity. So if you're building something, stay gritty, keep fighting through it because there's going to come a point when when this cycle is over. So this is a momentous point in history. Well shared, my friend. That's awesome. Thank you. Cool. My pleasure. Next episode, we're joined by the amazing Angel Jones. Stay tuned. Yeah, I'm a coach as well, right? So, I'm a coach and the podcast has helped me to to be a very good coach based on not just saying that you should go after your goals, but showing that I've gone after goals and achieved them.

vulnerable and positive platform you can get inspired and motivated from different leaders from our community today our guest is Kevin Moore who is the founder and managing partner of Sorak Ventures Kevin welcome to the show thank you for having me ah the pleasure is all ours Kevin I'm very excited to have you on um you are our first guest from The VC World um and I know that our listeners are going to be looking to hear a lot more about that and what you do but before we get into what you do currently in your journey could you just let us know a little bit more about your cultural background and where you grew up so I was born in Tulsa Oklahoma and I'm a Jamaican Heritage my father actually met my mother in Jamaica when he was there for something I think he was there on some church related matters and they fell in love and then they wrote each other for a year letters not text not Twitter nothing like that handwritten matters back and forth from the states to Jamaica and ultimately they got married and she came to United States and that's I grew up in a Jamaican household oh great great food oh that is right that culture the Jamaican coach I'm also Jamaican as well too have Jamaican have St Lucian so it's always good to know there's another Yard Man I don't know yes yes the food is always good you know I I know people be babbling sometimes and saying other Islands got some good food but I think Jamaica holds it down I think that was probably the channel most challenging part my wife is from America and I've always said to her man you could ever learn to cook Jamaican food that would just be like hey man my dream come true don't worry they got they got some they got some recipe books out there somewhere here you go right well you guys start going to Barnes and Nobles and find it right uh what we're like go on what are you gonna say I was gonna say not the same but oh true that is true that is true and this brings me to the next question right now I want to know like what were some of the the lessons that you learned as in your childhood that kind of helped you today I mean obviously growing up in a Caribbean household I know there's a lot of that strong Heritage and like pushing and driving and stuff like that but what are some of the lessons that you learned you know there's often a stereotype that Jamaicans work a lot of jobs and I wouldn't say that they're all false but I never really saw that it was more so we were always busy working on something and while you had your full-time job there was always some sort of side hustle that everyone in the family always had especially my uncles uh my Uncle Bobby Robert Frazier I mean he worked for atmt by day kind of installing uh at the time mobile phones into cars but he was always working on something else whether it was working on cars or installing some electrical equipment somewhere that was just what we sort of grew up around so everyone always hustling and doing things even my grandfather who they still maintain their house and a church in Jamaica but they always had side businesses I know growing up learning about him while he was running that church he was also a truck driver worked for a trucking company and they used to ship goods back and forth between Jamaica and Cuba and they would take ferry over there and he would drive and I didn't learn this until later but he was also fluent in Spanish which I speak Spanish now so I never knew that he had that sort of background but growing up it was just a culture of hard work and my mom always used to tell me it's better to try and fail than to not try at all and that's sort of my mentality but I go through life that's very big right there you know sometimes people get a little nervous and worried and like I don't know if I want to try it but you never know you never know and I uh you you all right about that Jamaican I actually have a story I actually have a story about that whenever we get to it but uh that one piece of advice really motivated me to make a huge career transition steps that if I had not listened to that advice I wouldn't be where I'm at today yeah parents always knew what was best for us you know they would say they were speaking metaphors you know the Caribbean culture and you'd be standing there like what you said it don't make no sense but you know 10 years later you're like oh you know what that made perfect sense that made perfect sense now I'm I I know growing up as a child you know there are always those uh challenges in uh someone's life right what would like some of the few challenges that you had to deal with as in your childhood that kind of shape you professionally in your journey I used to be really ashamed to talk about some of the challenges that my brother and I experienced growing up my parents divorced when I was probably five or six and we ended up Living With My Father and after that divorce things were pretty tough my dad ended up losing a job we ended up losing our house then we were homeless for a little bit living in sort of a back House of a friend of his and uh it was tough but it was a tough time I think our entire the entirety of my fourth and almost half of my fifth grade spent living in that in those conditions and you know I always try to sell myself everybody at some point they're you know if they have went through hard times that went through something difficult but I remember those days vividly from you know they're not being a bathroom there not being Heating and Air in that facility and feeling embarrassed with my friends at school who wanted to come over and play tell them I couldn't I mean we were legitimately without a lot of resources but I think that was it's something now that I embrace you know especially as I've worked in venture capital and there's a Frida Kapoor capor at k-por Capital in San Francisco probably at a conference that she was talking about this sort of subjective metric that she uses to gauge uh with some entrepreneurs he called it the distance traveled metric and she said that you know where people are in life is not a function of sort of the things that they 've accomplished on their own it's a function of you know a lot of things that they've had to overcome and she said that I would rather work with someone who's overcome a tremendous amount of obstacles to get where they are versus someone who's at the same point but didn't have to overcome as much so again I I vividly remember that particular particular period of my life and then some others but I always think man my distance traveled metric in comparison to other people who do what I do I think mine is pretty high but again I don't know everyone else's story all I know is mine well you definitely did come up on top you know and then you said fourth and fifth grade out that's pretty young you know to be yeah yeah I was probably how are you in the fifth grade 10 or 12. I was going to say yeah and you know obviously this is when you want to socialize and hang out with your friends like you said you tell them like you can't come over you know and then to find that finding other ways of still being active in school but knowing that when you go home those those issues will arise again and to stay focused you know at that young you had to really you know be that much stronger inside internally to really process that and really still manifest your dreams and still pursue what you want to do well you know the thing is in hindsight it's easy to say that but when you're going through it you know I think when kids are going through situations like that you kind of just sort of you know it's not great but at the same time you don't know of any other option I mean you might see your friends or people around you living a certain way but you kind of learn to just sort of deal with what you have I mean kids I think are the most resilient people out there quite frankly more resilient than some adults and I think going through those periods in my life was more like you know we just had to do it and that was one sort of phase and then the next phase was we moved to a pretty bad neighborhood and seeing a lot of crime and people getting jumped and people running through the neighborhood with weapons and shootings and just all those different things I mean you I wouldn't say you get used to it but you certainly get to a point to where you can just I wouldn't say becomes a regular part of the day but you do kind of get used to it and you still know it's not good you just don't like it but what else can I do it's not like I could lead the situation I think for a Time in my the way that my brother who roughly 12 or 13 months older than I am he responded to the divorce and to the situation differently than I did I think I had the benefit of being the younger sibling who saw the decisions he made and thought of decisions some of my father made and I had the privilege of I would say privilege but I was fortunate enough to be able to observe that and see the outcome of their decisions and think man I would like to try to be something different I want to do the opposite of that so it's kind of like a reverse role model effect where I've never for a large part of my life I was never motivated by people who were successful I was always motivated by not wanting to mess up and see and repeat the mistakes that everyone else around me was making that's not really a good way that's not really a good way to to live your life I will say that I've moved away from that but for a time I was always motivated by failure than success at a young age I mean again you you that that story alone and being able to think like that now what was like some of your aspirations as a child like growing up like as you're going through all of this did you know that you wanted to be in finance or in the VC uh sector I did not I was curious I wanted to be an engineer I was very into art and drawing and I thought I could translate that into you know building things I was a curiosity led me to think man with all this with all this curiosity maybe I should be an engineer because I always wanted to know how things worked and that's what I did I originally wanted to be an architect and when I got into college I realized that wasn't the path that I should take but engineering was sort of that path I actually didn't get interested in finance until my very last year in college just from again curious about numbers and I was good at math and started reading about investing an interesting story I went to uh visited a church with my wife I guess I guess my girlfriend at the time now why and I met this pastor and he was just like man you should work in finance you know basically he said that to me and I think that popped my interest but what that led to and sort of what I realized later this is when we actually left the state of Oklahoma I was living in Chicago I'm really really dove into finance and started thinking how much of a difference it was making in my life just from saving and investing and I started doing a lot of that stuff on my own and then I thought man I'm doing fairly well for myself perhaps I could do that for other people and that's what sort of that was the transition point I see I see I see now what was it like after graduating from Oklahoma State like I know you went back and you went back for your MBA as well too is that correct yeah I think that is correct um graduation was I felt like my chance to sort of chart my own path and sort of the limits of the the chains were were off and I could do whatever I wanted to do and within a week of graduating I had left you know part of part of leaving where I grew up was intentional but also a way of I wouldn't call it a state but just a chance to sort of start over right and build my life the way I wanted it and uh I did that you know we we left school I mean I was living in Chicago less than a week after graduating you know we had found the church and I had a new job we were making new friends and I was just creating this entire new identity and I still think at that time while I was rebuilding relationships not many people knew who I was I would say very few knew who I was because I purposefully left a lot of that part of my identity behind me and I just didn't want to embrace I didn't want to embrace it and I still like even this interview I still feel odd talking about it because it's like when I always think about the future and try to stay positive and and like working hard to always try to work hard in some cases just distract myself from some of those things that I was telling you earlier but for a long time you know you know being being in Chicago and being out of school was like this defining point of like all right I'm going to create who I want to be and nothing's gonna stop me and what would like some of those struggles you face after you like your education like trying to identify your career path uh I think the Imposter syndrome is very real and when you come from like in my background and you know where you're like the first person to go to college and and I imagine that a lot of people listening to this feel the same way it's like you're probably the first person to go to college you're the first person to do a lot of things and you're entering into environments where the majority of people have an experience what you've experienced so I think wrestling through their emotional and psychological components of that that is like very real and I think that you guys are really on to something with these type of conversations because it does I think it does resonate with a lot of people in that regard because again I don't think I'm unique it's just more so it's a really good question around you know how do you continue to strive towards success despite all those things it's now motivation but it is it wasn't it was an issue for a while and what helps you get through that and when now you're talking about these struggles you're talking about the you know a lot of these transitions you know from school to the the divorce to you know college you know all these things are happening but you're as you could see through your story visit this uh is Beauty in the story like every time you kept moving forward something new came into you right you came into a new a new place to live you getting married you're graduating things kept on coming but how what kept you motivated to keep moving forward I think you know it's like number one I've always believed that if wherever I was there was there for a purpose and I feel like people for me I find my purpose in in God and finding like strength in that sort of one thing that never changes and I felt like if I got through all that and God tells me where I'm at for a reason and I've always sort of anchored myself on that regardless of what was happening around me so I I can't I don't want to take credit for things that I had no control over I think there's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad but most people like don't choose the bad things that happen to them and to a certain extent yeah when something really good happens to them people want to take they want to claim they take credit for it when really it could have just been a blessing and I I don't want to be the type of person it's like oh I worked so hard in all these things and all these great things like no I give full credit for uh the blessing from God from for all everything that I have right now and I think this is this is something that as a VC I talk about too the reason why like we build portfolios of companies is because we don't know which one of those companies will be successful we know that the probability is that a few of them will but we don't know which ones at the beginning and it sometimes bothers me when I see my some people in the industry take like all this credit for these companies that succeed it's like they knew the whole time I'm like you don't know so I think I think about my life the same way it's like my the only thing I can control is I can wake up and do my work and and stick to the fundamentals and accept the good along with the bad and hopefully over the long term that works out well and I think that when you for me as I've lived like a life of faith that way my faith has never went up or down it's always been the same because I don't look at the outcome of how things turn out to determine how faithful I'm going to be for something does that make sense you better you better you better drop a gem right now that was very deep and I appreciate you sharing that you know because I know a lot of times when people are going through stuff it's very hard to kind of get out of it but this as you said you got to believe in eye and power you know whatever it is you know beside yourself to kind of get you there but I like how you said you just kept it neutral no matter what blessing came you where what struggle came your way you just you kept it even along the way and you mentioned the key word and then you said the keyword VC right and I know some of our listeners are probably like VC what they talking about VC right for the people the audience that I don't know that don't know can you explain a little bit more about what uh VC does and um how to help Founders so Venture capitalists invest in typically early stage high growth companies usually in the technology sector because those are companies that are easy to scale meaning that you can put a lot a little bit of money into a company that doesn't require like a tons of hard assets or tremendous amount of sort of dollars in order to create like an exponential outcome so Venture capitalists is an industry where they are usually the people who are expecting the most risk and accepting a high failure rate when they invest into a company because they're hoping that one or two or three of those companies provides like a 20 or 30X return on their investment to make up for all of the Investments that didn't succeed prior I think that among asset classes you have your Venture Capital which is like the risky dollars then you have private equity which are your more or dollars that go to more mature companies that are still private and then you have your public companies that you can just invest in in the stock market or in your mutual fund or whatever but you know BC used to be like a cottage industry like really small and now it's evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry across the world I I I agree with you on that uh it's definitely growing and it's getting a lot more exposure and I'm glad you kind of broke it down to the um our audience members now I know in your profession there's a lot of connection right there's a lot of networking across the board and you gotta be I want to say connect with a very diverse group of people like how how do you successfully like navigate on the landscape and finding those individuals and those Partnerships meaningful Partnerships if anything I think that navigating the landscape comes with understanding how it works and how it's structured uh mirror layers to it right there think about like a Target like a bullseye or the target symbol like that inner core of the circle is say you and then with or let me say differently let's say that's just the the startup financing center of the universe when you move out to each concentric Circle there's there's layers like if you're raising money for a company the first people you talk to are your family or friends great you need two hundred thousand dollars if you go to the people you know and you can get that money the next circle out are organized Angel investment groups and Angel Investors are typically higher Network people who are investing their own money into startup companies and what they will do is they'll organize groups of 25 50 people who meet on a regular basis to look at deals they're not professional investors but they have more money to invest than your family and friends and then one step above that is where you start to enter into Venture Capital where you have your pre-seed seed et cetera and then so on a PE and public markets but I talk about that because when you think about navigating the sort of environment of investing in private markets understanding each of those layers will help you sort of navigate like hey if I'm raising money for a company and I need a hundred thousand dollars well then you're probably not going to go talk to a venture capital you're probably going to want to get connected to an angel group or your family and friends so for my industry when I'm thinking about finding different investment opportunities or looking for co-investors or even looking for Founders depending on the stage that I'm looking at I'll know which one of those sort of rings within the circle to start either marketing to or attending events or reaching out to people on LinkedIn and in my network and start sort of building those relationships because now that I've been in the bit in the VC space for almost 10 years I have a number of people that I know in the industry so I just need advice or access to deals or access to other investors it's more of Uh I that did not come overnight but it is something that I've learned how to navigate fairly well now was that something I came about when you were um a financial advisor at Morgan Stanley and I know you were at Northwestern Mutual as well did those days yeah those are these influence you well yeah so I just just to clear things up for the audience so after I got my degree in engineering I worked that job for two years and then I went to work in finance as a financial advisor wanting to help people with their Investments Etc if I did that for four years at Northwestern Mutual and then two years at Morgan Stanley and that's when I went back to school to get my mbas and during that time I went I was working at the Federal Reserve Bank as a bank examiner before I went to work at a firm called i-2e which is where I first got my started investing in early stage technology companies and then I went to work on the lp side as a partner at a venture capital funded funds manager before starting um it's Iraq Ventures so having that sort of color across the financial industry you know sort of informed me with how to sort of navigate through things for sure but it wasn't just one place it was really a culmination of all those different areas now the transition from engineering to finance is like a unique Journey overall right you know if you're an engineer and you said you want to look into at one point looking into being an architect and then you switch over in the finance world and you know into investment you know how did you leverage like your civil engineering degree uh to then move into that Financial role Engineers are really good at solving problems and I always thought that okay he was a civil engineering major and that was something he enjoyed doing and I would be like bro it's over like it's over like leave that alone he's like no you got this week I like solving these things well I tell you that is a it's a blessing and a curse and I think that you can do that to an extent and I I actually had to learn how to not do that and people always thought man it's going to be hard for you to transition from thinking like that but that wasn't the part of in being an engine or Diet Grace and I feel like I took over but in addition to solving problems Engineers are also really good at like process mapping and when I think about the application of what I learned as an engineer it's not so much yes the ability to break down problems as it relates to whatever it is whether it's a business whether it's marketing or whatever but also creating processes for things such as like hey here's the map of how we're going to do this and if it's a business for example one of the things we talk about is finding like positive unit economics in a business and basically what that means is if you can figure out a way to repeatedly make money then how do you build a process to make sure that it happens every single time and when I think about the application of that the companies that's one thing I'm always thinking about like what's your process for doing X Y or Z so that sort of framework for solving problems comes from understanding the process and I always talk about this like with my daughter who she she doesn't love math and I always tell her like man to me Matt was the most straightforward subject in school because there was very little subjectivity in it that is correct one thing somebody one of our previous guests not to cut you off funny but one of our previous gets to the exactly those words said you can't one plus one is two there's no question there's no argument there's no back and forth there's no gray area so math is definitely that's why he was like I forgot it I think he did he did something in finance and Lisa that's why he moved in that direction because he said he couldn't do the back and forth stuff yeah I love math for that reason and I will tell you though sometimes in this the market if you see one plus one doesn't always equal two but I mean that from the standpoint of like sometimes things that don't make sense like how in the world are certain companies super successful the market changes and then sometimes every time in the world that some other companies fail he was like that's the sometimes and that's I wouldn't say that that's the norm but for the most part that's what I've appreciated about sort of the carryover from what I was trained to do as an engineer to uh think about things as a BC is the processes and just the ability to sit down and think about how does this work how can I get to a solution and I know in the VC world and in other places in Corporate America this is something that we always talk about and and try to just obviously want to hear your opinion on it is the lack of diversity right and I want to kind of hear your opinion on the speaking a little bit more on the lack of diversity in the VC world and like with the lack of like minority Founders getting in you know investment opportunities you know if you could talk a little bit more about that BC industry in my opinion is probably the least diverse industry of Industries but understanding why was important for me and I think it's important for everyone it's like for the most part the the industry was started by technologists years ago back in like the 1940s and at that time obviously the United States was very segregated very white male dominated and whenever companies within that industry early on were successful there's people within those networks were the ones who benefited from those rewards and then that just perpetuated itself and the hard part about venture capital and the reason why like Venture Capital firms have so much difficulty scaling themselves is because so much of what they do is Network driven in that they need to hire someone they're going to call one of their friends if they're looking to invest in a company they usually find their best opportunities by someone who refers that company to them so when you compound that over decades you start to see an industry that's very homogeneous very insular very Network driven and very and I mean it's not just by ethnicity I'm talking about by geography even by the types of companies and Founders that they're looking at and I actually wrote a white paper internment I haven't actually published this yet uh about how technology has made it so much easier for people to actually start a company especially with like AWS and the cost of server space going way down no code low code technology making it so much easier for people to come up with an idea and build that well that's led to over the last 10 or 15 years and a huge wave of entrepreneur entering the market not just on the coast but all over the country in markets like mine markets throughout the Midwest south east south west and then um in that new class of founder are women and people of color building amazing companies so for me it's like when you think about like less than one percent of venture capital goes to like black Founders and less than three percent goes to women and people of color including black in general and you're like okay well in 2022 there was close to 250 billion dollars invested into uh and to buy VCS and only three percent of that's going to those Founders like that's a problem not only is that a problem but a person's an enormous opportunity for firms like mine who are saying hey we will open the doors to all talented people and I think that's an advantage for like my firm and again I'm not the only one like this but to my friend of saying hey if you're a talented person we could care less about your ethnicity or your your genderness I want to talk to you okay let's get it let's get it if it makes sense it makes sense you know I think it makes sense it makes sense and I think for a long time these boundaries have not have a seat at the table and quite frankly like I was saying earlier like I said I'm an opera I wouldn't say I'm an opportunist but I do think that I would rather work with someone who kind of like me where they've had to overcome so many obstacles just to have a seat at the table I'll take that founder all day because I know that they're going to work their butts off and they're not going to be dismayed when they encounter challenges and problems and they're just going to keep going and keep fighting because they've had to do that just to get in front of me yeah yeah just and and if you think about it too like just imagine the amount of years and experience you know these people acquire you know by doing that so you're right you know it's it's harder to back away as an end there's a lot of money on the line too you know if you got to that place in time where someone's willing to invest in your company Hey look it's time to put up some more if you thought you was working back then you know start working even more right right I give I give it to you and and I give it to your firm as well too for just you know giving an opportunity to people that probably would never have that opportunity you know to sit at that table and and share like hey look this is my company this is what I'm looking to do and you guys have the ability to say yay you know it's crazy though you know there's been like a surge of funds sort of trying to faculty's problem when it comes to like money going to diverse Founders and immigrants and just people of color in general and while it seems like we're making progress like it's still such a small dent in the bigger number that you know people say hi to you Source deals and how are you getting access to the opportunities and I wish the better question would be man given that you have a wide aperture for accepting what was once a completely closed off group of Founders how are you even handling the amount of deal flow that you're getting to me that would be a good question come on yeah there's like so many like of these hungry entrepreneurs and passionate entrepreneurs I've never had the chance to talk to a VC that I'm not kidding you the deal flow is very robust but for the firms that sort of dominate the fundraising environment they're the ones they're not they're not looking at these founders at least they're not looking at them as much so I feel like that's the best their questions just like meant Kevin given that you are looking at diverse Founders and women like how are you handling the deal quote not how are you getting vehicle and with that being said like you're you're with your cultural background the things that you've gone through in your life schooling and as well too right you're you have access to a lot of like information that potentially could help in a potential investment like could you tell us a little bit more about like how you how your cultural background could provide you with like distinct you know Insight that potentially an investor and uh would kind of overlook at some point I mean a really good example is into a company that I that I was referred to called solo funds and I ended up investing in the company but these two guys started this company Travis and Rodney uh their idea initially was to build a peer-to-peer lending Network where individual lenders who had extra cash and individual borrowers who needed cash could borrow borrow and lend money to each other in small dollar increments and these two guys built this company based upon the market environment that they grew up in and growing up they said that you know people would typically have to go to get a payday loan loan or they were getting turned down for uh loans from the bank and Banks typically don't like to lend in this area because it's historically not been profitable but when they were talking about those types of people who need two hundred dollars to get their tire fixed or they need 50 to 100 because they have some small build pop up I'm just like man I know that market because I grew up around a lot of people like that they have to explain it to me I just I just got it and it's a really I think a really strong example of when you have in a broader and more diverse base of investors that can understand some of the challenges that certain entrepreneurs are solving for based upon markets that would have been historically been underserved then you can start to understand how they're coming up with Creative Solutions to build products to serve those customers that were previously underserved and that company has absolutely crushed it and they had told me that when they were first starting to approach Venture capitalists that it took a long time for them to educate some VCS about this market and why it was substantial because they and it's just because they just didn't get it they didn't come from that place so I think that having a diverse background and even understanding like you know what's the path of an immigrant like how do they think about navigating things in this country or what's it like to come from an underserved market and is there opportunity there I'm going to listen to that story because I get it and I'm glad you are taking an opportunity to sit with somebody in here because even if it doesn't work out I know that the conversation that you're sharing with them is also going to give them some insight to kind of walk away and say you know what uh it didn't work out but Kevin definitely put me in the right direction gave me some some valuable tips to some pointers that could help me out for the next time do you allow people to come back oh for sure yeah I never looked at I mean my mentality is how do I add value every single time and I have to write the biggest value I can add is just being honest with people it's like hey this isn't going to work because you got to do this differently or do that differently than if it is something that I can help with great if it's not that I can try to point people in the right direction but I mean the world of VC is like that not every single company is going to raise the capital that they need and it's just a matter of how I use this platform to be a resource in whatever way I can sometimes it's Financial sometimes it's not now if you're in your background you have a a large background in um Finance investment landscape like how do you stay adaptable I mean Forward Thinking especially like considering like you know technology and like all these market trends you have to I think the most people in this business are constantly talking to people attending conferences I read a lot and part of that is intentional just to understand like what is happening with technology um now I don't think anybody knows 100 what's what technology is going to be the one that sort of takes out but I think you know before I got into this industry I never really thought about like what's coming next or what how can technology be applied to certain industries or some of these new newer Industries like the Creator economy and what's stuff that's happening with AI and space exploration and future of work and all those different things like most people are like not thinking about that and quite frankly and even with all the stuff that was happening with like blockchain and web 3 and all this thing and one thing I said to somebody was I was like the average person they do not care about any of that stuff that I just said all those categories all they care about is the some does something work right no one like when you go in when you walk into a room and flip on the light switch you're not thinking it's like oh I wonder how that works and how do I get tired of them you just want to know that the light switch the light turned on that's that right come on now come on that's it but people who that's the engineering you right there right you want to know go ahead and I was gonna say that you want to know how it turns on you're like all right where's this connected to right you're probably that person that did it that's sitting there at a dinner table everyone's having a good conversation you're staring at everything like yep that right there is connected to that and that could that foreigners real quick yeah and I think that most VCS are kind of like that they're just curious about like how does that work and who are the companies that drive in that or making that and you know looking at things like an investment opportunity so when I think about new technology I know that I need to stay aware of like all these different things that are happening because there are they are the things that make people's lives hopefully better but I think the average person is just and again I'm not saying that because VCS or even anyone who has interest think about the stuff that they're better I just feel like it's my job to always be in the know about what's happening what technology is there for I stay abreast of that and with your career path that you've we're talking about you know 17 plus years 17 plus years of experience in finance and investing you know could you talk about like a moment that led you to establish your business you know it wasn't until I started working at my last firm where I started at my last form we had the opportunity to invest both in Venture Capital firms and also into investment by co-investments into direct companies with some of those VC firms and it really wasn't until I was there that I started to see this enormous opportunity of targeting Founders that traditionally were not getting venture capital because I was spending a lot of time on the road mainly in San Francisco like the Bay Area and you start when you go to some place so much you really start to understand the rhythm of a place and how it works and how people think and where the opportunities are sorry about that the phone ring um that was really there was a turning point like prior to writing pandemic where I said it's like man there's a there's a big hole in the market for dollars going to be more diverse people and and just geographically so I thought you know going back to when I was an engineer in Chicago I remember sitting at my desk this was in 2000 and fixed and I wrote myself an email and it was an email of all these things I wanted to do by the time I turned certain ages and one of them will start my own Venture Capital firm and I still have that email in my inbox I keep it there and I read it every now and then but I talk about that because one it's a reminder of like the power of writing on your goals and then the other is like what are the skills that I need in order to make that happen and I knew that it would happen at some point but the moment in time where I wrote it down I knew I wasn't ready for that to happen so all the places I've worked I knew that there was something I could take away from there in order to ultimately spin out and do something on my own but it really wasn't until I saw what was happening in the Venture Capital industry in more detail that I became like extremely motivated to think okay I've accumulated all this knowledge I've built up this network I understand what it takes to run and operate a fund now I feel like I'm ready and I think that the pandemic I think catalyzed that tremendously for a lot of people who decided to sort of do their own thing but I think in general people have to get to a point to where they just decide to do something or they're just never going to do it at all but for me it was like feeling like I was ready before I could actually make it happen and uh I thought that this would have happened like seven or eight years ago me doing what I'm doing now but I think it happened at the right time it's unfortunate that it's happening in like a really tough Market where fundraising is like really hard but yeah it's it still drinks people ain't showing up right if it ain't a drink involved or something some good alcohol they're not gonna they're not they're not pulling up they're like what no wait is it a party or is it a fun race it's a mixture of those I think for like your audience who's listening the benefit that people have if they have you know when they have a diverse background is just seeing things differently you know that's a huge Advantage especially now in this market where differentiation is I think something that our culture or the U.S culture is really starting to embrace and um when you think about the most successful Tech founders in the United States ever I think it was like 45 or 50 percent of them were immigrants to this country it's like that's not an accident I think it's because they just see things differently and I just want to say cabinet thank you so much for like all this Insight that you've been dropping you dropped some significant gems and um I I greatly appreciate you just opening up and expressing like those hardships in your life because those hardships obviously shapes you to the man that you are today and um it's helped you in your career um through your Journey Through Your Story one thing that I I see which runs parallel to a lot of things you were saying is is that like how your mother said like just not giving up like it's better to try than to just not try at all I think that everything that came your way you tried and not only did you try you actually were very successful at doing it and um I just appreciate you for just just giving those words of advice to our listeners and uh I just want to leave it off if this is this if there's any words that you could share with you know aspiring immigrant entrepreneurs who are looking to like start their Journey or maybe even start a unique path in the finance industry what would you share with them I'll share probably three things that I live by but if I were to write a book with three quotes on it and these are all from people who personally had a big impact on me the first one I would say is however my mom said it's better it's better to try and fail and to not try at all that's the first one and I remember as a kid my dad would always tell us do the best with what you have and basically it's a keep an attitude of contentment and do the best with whatever situation you're with and then the last one is an advice of action I remember a person telling me he was like when you don't know what to do do what you know and that has always been something that has motivated me to take action and not sort of rest of my Laurels or think that I need to know everything before I do something so those would be the three quotes that I would leave for the listeners You're Gonna Leave This off like that You're Gonna Leave You Out Here living some punch lines making us really think of it listeners get your pens out get your pads out because heaven is dropping some gems on the show today uh Kevin again thank you thank you so much for your time and just for your knowledge um and just for just like again you should your your Vibe like it's amazing um Story Journey and I love uh connecting with you today now I appreciate the time and uh love to do it yes and I want to let the listeners know if you want to hear more stories like Kevin check us out on sakaconnect.com or follow our feed Saka wherever you listen to your podcast",

    "transcript": "Welcome to Swimming with Alligators, the VC podcast from the LP perspective with your hosts, Alexa Benz and Ernest. You ready? Let's dive in. On today's episode of Swing with Alligators, we're blessed today uh with two guests. Uh we have Rodin Etien and Kevin Moore. Rodlin is the founder and CEO of Daja Capital with over 25 years of institutional investment experience supporting emerging fund managers. And Kevin is the founder and managing director of Sarak Ventures and has over 16 years of experience as both a LP and GP. Today they are sharing with us how allocators new to venture should approach the asset class and why GPS should focus on building the relationships and not rushing the relationships with LPS to close the deal. Uh with that, glad to have you both Kevin and Roslin. Pleasure to be here. Thanks for having us. No problem. No problem. Thanks for being here. Um, so I always like to start off all these shows with just, you know, how did you come to this like alligator world and just your respective journeys. So uh would love to first start with Roslin uh if you could share your backgrounds and how you got to this point. Sure, happy to do so. I uh am in the allocator world because of the Tuigo Foundation. I was uh awarded the Tuigo Foundation fellowship when I went to business school. Tuigo is an organization that was created 35 years ago to encourage minority MBA students to pursue careers in finance. My entree into the world where I made my career was a day that Tuigo organized for the West Coast Fellows to go up to Sacramento and meet Calpers. And I grew up in New York. I heard of Wall Street. I was completely unaware of this by side investing world until that moment. And that opened a door in a window into a world where essentially I made my entire career. To be frank, I have a very non-traditional path into venture capital. I got my degree in civil engineering, but started exploring and thinking about finance. My last year in college, couldn't start over. I was on a six-year college program and I wasn't going to stay any longer. I did engineering uh for two years after college and then made the switch to switch into finance just to learn the business and ultimately try to get into venture capital at some point in my career. That was a 8-year period of working at a few different institutions in the financial services arena before first joining in VC on the GP side investing in startups and then also spending some time on the LP side investing in funds and co-investing along with them before starting Sarra Ventures. So as you said that was a 16 plus year period where all those different things happened. Uh but it was a great decision and a great journey. Hey Kevin, because you have this interesting perspective of multiple hats, you know, both the allocator and and GP hat. If you put on your uh alligator hat, which I I was trying to think about this today. I don't know if it's a top hat or I don't know what kind of hat it is. Uh little rabbit out of it. I don't know. Rabbit out of it. I don't know what. It's a fedora. It's a fedora with with with I like fedoras. Let's say let's stay with that. It's a fedora. But if you put that on um were there any lessons during like as you were learning you know you had some experience in directly investing and then you know how was it learning about how to invest in funds and what were you looking for at the time? The biggest takeaway I got from working on that side of the table was the best fund managers were those who had very streamlined operations. And I say that because most of the funds that we saw that failed, it was because they didn't. And that always stuck with me. And when you think about most of the companies that VCs are going after, they're very competitive and and things of that sort, but they usually all invest in good companies. But where things seem to always fall apart were they didn't have a process for sourcing. They didn't have a process for secession. They didn't have sort of clean operations. So that was one of the things that I learned the most and was a big takeaway for me in starting Surak Ventures was seeing behind the scenes of how the best fund managers in the world really built their firms and how they scaled and had people doing different things. That was a very helpful experience and I think that that was very lucky to have had that sort of inside baseball of the business before starting my firm. I'm just going to pull a thread there. How do you actually determine if someone has streamlined operations? Because I've looked at a lot of my friends like GPEX. I've been at funds and seen our kind of fundraising decks and just like we can say about a lot of you know founders and in different spaces. They all kind of start to blend together and look the same and everybody is saying the same talking points. How do you really kind of look under the hood to determine if somebody has streamlined operations? I think just like any company, the GP is kind of like the CEO and their sort of visionary approach to where the firm's going, what they're investing in is one thing, but most of the firms that are in the business are structured pretty much the same where you have your lower level people doing what they do, your mid tier, then you have your operations people, and then you have the dynamics that exist between the GPS and that's sort of like your leadership team or your seauite and how is that sort of laid out such that it's fair and equitable among them and for the firms that did that really well you could tell there was a a pattern to it and the firms that didn't they seem to just be figuring that out and VC firm to me is no different than any company it's just a different medium where you're applying that model. So I think for both Rodland and I when we're looking at an investment, there's just certain fundamental things that make sense and the framework by which you're looking at that just depends on the industry, but structurally it has to operate a certain way. Roslin, you you start you you brought up Twiggo, which I'm I'm glad I have a lot of friends who've gone through that program and it's it's had, you know, made waves in all aspects of of finance. But I was curious, you know, as you then started your career as an allocator, what um were there any specific kind of like experiences or or lessons that have really shaped how you your perspective on investing in the managers? Uh, I think one of the things I didn't do in your first question was talk through the trajectory of my career. So, post business school with a little two-minute detour into real estate. Um, I ended up spending a large chunk of my career as a consultant advising institutional investors. That period was probably on the order of around 14 years working at two firms. And so throughout that decade plus experience, you know, I I saw everything and everyone really. And I think that my perspective is a little different than what I experienced because I viewed the structures and the processes that we had in consulting. And as someone who came to finance from a non-traditional background like Kevin, we have that in common. My perspective on the processes, the moray, the standards of what we were doing in consulting always seemed to me a little bit different from what we said versus the reality of what we did. Mhm. And I think that that understanding how the business was structured in terms of the gatekeeper, the allocator and ultimately the manager and understanding the relationships between all three um was important for my perspective, but I think the most important thing is I have a critical eye on just about everything and I think process is essential. Um but process that doesn't allow for creativity is not optimal. All right? Because at the end of the day, what we are all doing is making judgments and judgments are not just based on the steps that you must do. There's a qualitative in assessment, there's intuition, and there's vision. And I think my trajectory has been about making sure that the intuitive qualitative aspect of judgment um is just as important as the process. Yeah, you you you bring up some some points that I've you know through all these conversations with LPS I've heard on just like it's it's it's an art and a science like how do you balance both knowing we need to be diligent and have diligence in a process but if you're so if you have your advisors on so much you might miss out on true alpha Um, that kind of leads to my next question, uh, for you, Robin. You decided to, you're a builder, uh, just like Kevin, and decided to start your own firm. With those kind of lessons in mind, how did you make sure that like your firm, what was the inspiration to start your firm, and what how did you make sure your firm incorporated all those lessons from your career? Um, I reached a point in my career where I was transitioning um, and I could have had what I call the board life. I was too young for that and that I had more to give to our business. And so I started Daja as what I call my third act or the third phase of my post business uh, school career. And I started it because it was purpose for me. I thought that there was a lot of talent out there that wasn't getting opportunity uh to demonstrate their brilliance. And I thought that one of the things I realized is that I have always been willing to go first both when I was a consultant and when I was a CIO and I didn't feel that that opportunity uh for someone to say I believe in you. I think you can be successful. let me help you start happened enough for people who look like us to be very frank. So that's why I started Daja. Plain and simple. It it it is my realization that opening doors and giving people a seat at the table who don't normally get it was what drove me and what was consistent in all of those professional highlight reel moments for me. And so I thought this is the thing that I could contribute in this chapter and this is why I started it. I love that. Uh and just point of clarification for our listeners, you said board life meaning B O A R D and not B O R E D. Right. Yes. The board life. I I joined a board that I'm still on. And you know, no, you know, at that phase in life, you can become a professional board member and have a interesting varied uh life, but I was too young for that. Yeah. Yeah. And and for some people it might be B O R E D. Um uh and um and Kevin, what was the inspiration to start your firm when you've had a successful, you know, career as, you know, both an LP, co-investor, all those things? Very similar. It wasn't until I started working on the LP side that I saw just the massive chasm that existed between where dollars went in the business. And I think that this became more apparent maybe starting prior to 2020. Mhm. It sort of became sort of top of mind and then during that period just had a lot more time to think through that and I started to think why was that? Was it because there was this sort of underlying bias in the business? I wasn't sure because it didn't seem like that when we were meeting with managers, but it really came down to network effects, I think, is a big a big part of that. And people aren't ever going to admit that they have even unconscious bias, but everybody has that. So, I wanted to start a firm that sort of leveled the playing field and would give everyone, like Rodlin said, a seat at the table. And I think it's a [Music] core reason for the depth of our connection is that very point. I feel like I'm an extension of what she's doing and and vice versa. And Sarak Ventures will look at all founders. And I think that that is a huge differentiator between the firms that exist in the market than and and and ones that are sort of coming up coming up like mine. I think that Kevin's point is is is important. I think why is it important for us to be doing what we're doing right it is because we have different lenses we have different lived experiences which is a cliche but I can't find a different way to say it which means that we look at opportunity in a different way and we see opportunity where others may not for that very reason and I think you know we all have biases, implicit, explicit, we all do. But the thing that I tell the marketplace is that you're not going to encounter from from me racial or gender bias, right? As a black woman, to be frank, you will encounter investment bias, right? I have biases as an investor that remains unchanged. But I can see the potential in ideas because of the differences and the experiences that I bring to the table. And it is it it is hard to make the generalization but I have personally experienced even the last couple of years where investment opportunity is not recognized. So true. We need more perspectives. We need more um seats at the table. We need more tables. All those things. And um you know, one thing I I wanted to just uh come back to, Kevin, that you brought up that I I just want to learn a little bit more, get both of your perspectives on is this idea of network effects and this concept of being able to prove your proprietary network and your ability to get access because that's honestly what as venture capitalists what we're selling is our ideas and our access. Have you found, you know, for you, Kevin, interesting ways to be able to convey that yourself versus also, were there things that you found found when you were an allocator as ways for people to really show that when it's not the most obvious? It's a really good question. It's like being in a bubble. Like once you're in there, you don't realize you're in there until you step out of it. And it's we it's a weird sort of thing when you really when you think about it. How do you demonstrate the the strength of your network? When I was in those rooms, I always felt that one, I was the only one in those rooms that sort of look like me, but at the same time, no one was looking at me different because I was in the room. And the strength of a network is subjective. Yes. It's like strong is relative to to what. But within the venture capital industry, there's been a history of different firms and people and ideas that tend to be people who scream the loudest. And when you can reach out to those people and have their perspective on things and you're in that network and you can illustrate that eure either through conversation or by direct inter introduction then I think that you can start to manifest that to others in in a material way and part of that network was driven by really introductions. And I I would say that some of the best founder relationships that I was able to build over the years came from doing reference calls on the fund managers that we had in our portfolio and they would introduce us to really big people like the founder of Ring and the founder of Door Dash and all these people. So you start to develop this network effect and now if you wanted to gauge that by a number you can see that on LinkedIn but I'm a big believer in sort of Dunar's number where none of us can have really strong relationships with more than 150 people. So when I think about network effects now, it's not so much of how do we sort of brag about our network, but more so how do we bring people into our network? And that's something that we're doing with technology. It's something I think about now and bringing in new investors to the venture capital industry because that to me is that's the broken part of this business. And I actually think it's very limiting because if you're only limited to your network, then you're not seeing all the opportunities and you may not have all the best people in it. I think a lot of people who've been on this show or that talking to in private who've been in the business for a long time there there isn't going to be like a succinct like right down the fair fairway um answer. Uh but that should give people like hope too. It gives me inspiration too. It's like, okay, I need to be the best earnest that I can be and show that I can out earnest everybody. I can out earnest. I think I might borrow that. I I I want to add a comment though about network, not just not in the VC context, but just in general, because I think what one of the things I realize is that we all live in these networks that don't necessarily intersect. And one of the things I'm doing in this phase of life is deliberately trying to connect networks that don't intersect. Right? I've had I have a series of networks that I'm a part of that are not necessarily related. Um and trying to intersect them and bridge them is one of the things that I'm intentional about. And at this point when people say to me, may I introduce you to the answer is always yes because there are so many you know if Kevin's point about you can only have meaningful relationships with 100 people imagine then how many real networks exist out there and you realize that in particular when you're talking about diversity and you'll have people say I don't know where to find the talent and my experience is I'm surrounded by the talent. Why can't you find it? Right? It's because their particular ecosystem and my ecosystem are separate and I realize that sometimes we have to function as the role as the connector as the bridge. Um and it means learning. It means being sometimes in places where it's uncomfortable because it's not your networks. But you know this was my experience for example working at Albright Stonebridge which is a completely different animal uh than all of the chapters that is a national security diplomacy global network of people who I have access to that I there's there's nothing natural about me being in that particular network if I hadn't made that move to connect with people who are not just strictly finance and I think to to the extent there's anybody early in their career um listening to this podcast, I think one of the pieces of advice I'd be is try to be intentional about cultivating um your networks because at the end of the day that's going to be key to everything in your professional life. Absolutely. And Ernest, can I say one thing that I just I'd be remiss if I didn't say this about the network thing? That doesn't mean you can sit back and make excuses because I know there are a lot of people on both sides and and of all ethnicities and and backgrounds that make excuses like I don't have a network. I don't know these people. Now, I will say and it's for both Rodlin and my not trying to speak for Rodlin, but I would assume how dare you, right? But I know for myself in order to build the network like I've had to force myself into situations and put myself in a lot of very uncomfortable situations. Yeah. And if you're not willing to do that, your network is never going to grow. Yeah. And that I think that's a really important point to say, especially in this climate that we're in right now, that at some point you have to just own up to it and embrace the the discomfort. And if you're willing to do that and just ask people out to coffee and ask people for advice and humble yourself and really try to push yourself in the rooms, that's how it that's how it works. If you're willing to do that, then yeah, that network effect can get stronger. Now, we're going to take a quick break to speak with our sponsor. On today's uh expert segment, uh we have uh our industry experts and sponsors, Shane Gaudy. He's a leader of Sidley's venture funds practice and Matthew Een partner at Sidley focusing on investment funds and private equity. How, you know, how does a a a firm like yours help navigate fund managers and all these different things? Yeah, I I think it's first and foremost just the breadth of experience and you know allowing clients who have never really had to think creatively about um you know getting to this liquidation part of their life spectrum and you know what's the playbook for that and and you know even today the playbook changes you know continuation funds in the venture context outside of very very large venture firms um who are you maybe in the growth stage, we're almost private equity-ish in many ways. Uh, you know, and the liquidity markets, right? It's just been god- aful to, you know, you get that you get that lack of liquidity and you pair that with really not having a lot of experience dealing with, you know, outlife fund management issues. It's very difficult and and now, you know, a lot of funds are coming back to market, but they've got, as you said, have that DPI. You know, they need that track record to be able to put gas in their fundraising tank. And so you have to talk about so many different aspects of these transactions. You know, um, you know, Matt has done incredible work on a, you know, a number of continuation vehicles in his past. Um, you know, I've done a lot of stuff over the years in terms of GP sort of secondaries, whether it's rights offerings. Um it's actually you know the the deepening of relationships and the necessity of GPS to broaden their uh connectivity to the secondaries world and secondary buyers. I think that is the part of the successful playbook of any venture fund these days. Um and and so I I think it's really just a matter of our job is is a matter of just opening up the playbook so people understand what the options are and also being able to tell them what the pros and cons of each are because a lot of these things are incredibly expensive. You know, continuation funds are not for the light of heart and you they are transactions that can be transformative, but they are also filled with a bunch of minds in the minefield that if you're not doing this correctly and there are so many conflict and fiduciary issues, there's so much expense drag to a lot of this, you know, there's a swamp out there, but you know, if you've got, you know, some of your swamp people who are in the boats being able to paddle you through it, you know, that's the kind of stuff that you need, you know, if you're really going to um explore the best options but you know they they take comfort in knowing that that there are you know relative ability but it's also knowing when to do it and um you know because LP temperature is really going to be based a lot about value created on these exit transaction it's not doing it for just the sake of doing it LPS are only going to bless it if it's you know they're getting juices worth the squeeze in a lot of the in a lot of these ways so um you know we get asked the question a lot these days and as markets open up um as secondary players become more broad, as transaction structures get more interesting, you know, this is absolutely something that is a material part of what we do on a day-to-day basis. I know Matt, what do you think? Yeah, on um I I've spent a lot of time on secondary transactions and I remember because I came to sort of law after career and policy, there would be a time at like 3:00 in the morning where you'd like pull back and you be like, why are we doing this? Like, are we sure that this is going to go through? And so that's the thing like when I have clients who are contemplating this, it's sort of like there are a ton of factors like that influence like if you put aside the assets, put aside the nav that you're going to get like what is your relationship like with your LPs? Like what is your LP base like? Are you going to get to majority um consent really easily? What's your uh advisory board like for the conflicts? things like that um that are really sort of like fundamental to a discussion and then it's also um you know with secondary transactions it's there is a lot going on. I would say there's sort of only one other instance where it is just like every single communication is complicated and LPS ask rightfully so ask a lot of questions and I have managers who say like we have 30 other initiatives happening right now like I don't think we're going to do this and I would say yeah that's pro you know like this one is a very timeintensive thing it's not like a fund raise where you can prepare ahead of time there things that come up all the time you have things outside your control with a lead buyer, things like that. And so um they are doable and they can bring liquidity um even in a market uh like now. But it's important to recognize these are very complex and you know it's not just us lawyers, it's bankers, it's accountants, it's um fairness opinion people. There are a lot of other expenses out there um that people should um you know think about as they're as they sort of dip their toe into secondaries. Yeah. Are are you all seeing um any you know changes uh over the last 12 months in the fund terms and governance structures that LPs are looking for? Yeah. Go ahead. Um, yeah, completely. You know, it it's it's so fascinating if you think of 21 and 22 where, you know, there was people ask questions and then GPS say, \"Okay, we're going to cut out your allocation.\" And now in in 24 and 25, it's just, you know, people want more reporting. People want disclosure about conflicts. Um, they want insight into investment pipeline. you know, there there's so many more things that result ultimately in more robust reporting, deeper relationships, but there's a lot more obligations and strings that come attached to the money now that we weren't seeing years ago. And then to what Shane mentioned earlier, there are also a lot more of an emphasis on separately managed accounts and funds of one that allow very large investors to set up, you know, vehicles that they can co-invest for reduced fees or free fees. they can invest across different strategies. Um so it's interesting that venture is you know somewhat becoming more like private equity and like the uh bespoke nature sometimes for large institutional investors and the products that managers are able to use to accommodate what they need. Yeah. I I I'd say that the things that I've seen change are the limited partners' request for accountability um in in any number of cases. is, you know, in particular if there's a key person event or um, you know, they want to be able to have inflection points across the fund life spectrum to um, put themselves in important decisions with respect to the fate of the fund. And if it's key person or if it's no fault divorce or if it's uh no fault GP removal or GP removal as a topic or you know anything and all points in between. I I think that there has just been much more LP insistence on um making these life events of any management team of a fund or the fund itself um be something that's accountable, reportable, transparent to the limited partners. And that's not to say that GPS give in on this a lot or even a little uh in many ways, but nonetheless, I think that there's been a there's been a tremendous amount of discussion around the consistency of reporting and notifications of the life events. LPS want to know what's going on with the fund and they want to know it more often than a quarterly report that they're getting or an annual meeting they may be having. they want to have it um as much and as often as they possibly can. And so I think that just the relative involvement of the LP community in the day-to-day of a venture fund has is more now than it ever has been for good and for bad. And and I think it some of that is dependent upon who you talk to whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. obviously the rise of Ilpa um and you know a specific set of guidelines and the overall meteor you know um impact of that on the the relative um negotiation posture of GPS and LPS and insistence that something may be market and something isn't and you know all of that sort of leads to I just not circumspection but I just think that LP's desire to be much more involved in not the management, but just understanding operationally how decisions are made and what's going on with the fund. And if things go incredibly left or incred incredibly right, LPs want to be involved and I think they want to say in the future of the fund and what the management team may look like and their rights visav all of that. And now back to our LP interview. [Music] You guys are are both talking about something that is is is you know is is uh is my TED talk on you know growth comes with discomfort right? Some of the best gifts in life come from discomfort. Every every mother I know says some of the best gifts of their life that they've ever had their children came from discomfort. And so that's something that we kind of have to live by. Um, one reason I wanted to have both of you on this show was because of the partnership that you both have. And Ryan, you brought up earlier that, you know, given your demographics and who you are, there's certain biases you won't have, but you're also definitely going to have kind of investment bias. And I remember our first conversation uh even before we got reconnected the first first conversation we had you were like yeah yeah you were like what was uh you were like well I don't really do venture and and and so I get that but you're you're invested in in Kevin. What was it about Kevin and that you saw that you were like, I want to invest and partner with what he's building, even if it's an asset class that I'm not as familiar with. So, you know, um I think that's a great question. I'm going to try not to soup him up too much, but Oh, no, no, no. I don't I don't want that. I want I'm not I want I want you to provide insights for other people to feel hopeful, but like Yeah. But but but your point your point is a good one, right? Because it was not my intention to say, \"Oh, I'm going to back a VC fund, right? I allowed myself the opportunity set, I'm agnostic. I'll back anybody who's doing something in the private markets.\" But if you had asked me what would have been first, this is not what I would would have expected to do. Yeah. Um I thought Kevin was special. Right. So, as someone who has, you know, the metaphor I use is I've seen the play thousands of times before, there's an element of intuitive recognition about talent that comes, I think, just because I've seen the play thousands of times before. And in Kevin, what I saw were the things that were kind of the gating mechanisms for me, which is what do I like in an investor? what attracted me to a manager or a GP when I was a consultant or an allocator, right? What ultimately were the characteristics that I found compelling and I will say a couple of them. The one is the GP and Kevin is very passionate about what he's doing. So, first of all, smarts, all of that. That's table stakes, right? You know, we're not going to put that at the front here. I'm just going to assume that I'm not going to invest with somebody who I don't think is smart and and and good at what they're doing. But you have to exhibit a certain passion for the area that you're investing in. You have to have an investment philosophy and a perspective that um you bring to the markets that you're investing in. And you have to have the right balance of confidence and humility. Right? The best investors, the investors that I've always been attracted to, have a point of view, but are always trying to be better and are always questioning themselves and questioning whether their circumstances or the market has changed and have asked themselves, do we need to adapt? Not do we need to change our basic investment philosophy, but the idea of continuous improvement is one of those things that I think is very important. And I thought that Kevin possessed those things, right? Besides, you know, character, integrity, and all of that other good stuff, which we should not underestimate because I think it's important in a longterm, very difficult endeavor that we're all going through as builders. And I I say that's that. And I don't want to again, I don't want I don't want the ego to blow up too much. I'm going to stop there. No, no. We want we we want him to we want him to have something to strive for. the ability to continue a little bit. Yeah. Um Kev Kevin, I have a kind of to that point and I think in the market today, um you know, I'm not going out on a limb by saying that it's a tough fundraising market in particular to venture capital, right? Especially emerging managers. And it might be a point of time where, you know, I'm hearing from a lot of friends, oh, we we need to expand kind of the pool of capital and look at other folks that could be allocators into this asset class. So, how do you think our emerging managers should think about convincing people who are either sour on the asset class from recent kind of like indicators or who have don't have much experience in the asset class at all? I want to answer that, but I also want to thank Rodlin for your kind words. It means a lot to me. It's also a testament of our relationship because I feel the same about her and our meeting was the most different type of meeting I've ever had in my career just in general because of how you approached wanting to know who I was and why I was doing what I was doing. still no one asks me those things and I think it's so important to doing what we do because it is such a long-term business. Yeah. So I I I want to say that and to answer your question Ernest I think that what the perspective I gained just over the years not just working in venture but also working in finance is that you as an investor you see that there's cyclicality in the market and if you understand just the fundamentals of that one of the things I try to tell new investors to the asset class is venture goes through waves and if you can point to not only specific examples of period periods, but also what happened during those periods. You can start to educate people about why now might be one of the best times to invest in venture capital ever and why this happened over the course of history. I don't think history repeats itself exactly, but it certainly rhymes. So I think now with the asset class as it is today, we are possibly at a nater and on the way back out of this. I don't know if that's this year or next year, but if you zoom out and look at the course of a 10-year period, where you don't want to be investing is in 2018 2019 when the market was at a high. And that's exactly what happened, which is so bizarre to me. But at the same time, it's not bizarre because no one knows if that's the high, but we certainly know when it's the low. So, educating people on those things is part of the the process of being a good salesperson, but a good salesperson educates doesn't sell people things that they don't need. In February, we wrote an investor education series talking about all these fundamental things about venture capital. And ideally, we'll structure those together in a package and share that with individuals who are accredited investors and might have interest in venture capital. But just to say, hey, here's here's the playbook on how this works. Cuz some people just don't know. But some people who even do know just need to be reminded that the cyclicality of this business never going away. And when we're in these periods, it's time to embrace it and double down on it. I can can I cosign on that because I think you know Ernest if I think about your prior question why did I when you met me the first time I said I'm not really into venture and then all of a sudden I'm backing a venture fund it's not just also Kevin it's also I think that you have to be slightly contrary to be a successful investor yes and so therefore you know after this particular bubble burst I thought okay well now may actually be a good time to do venture And so besides I thought he was an exceptional GP, I thought this was also a good time to put money to work in venture. Yeah. And I think investors who have the stomach and don't follow the herd, you know, you don't you don't buy at the peak. You know, you try to buy the trial. You may not be able to time it, but if you have the right long-term perspective, I think that approach makes a whole whole bunch of sense. Kevin, you mentioned that Roin had just like your experience with her was just very different than some other um LP conversations that you had. Um what do you think allocators today should be doing differently in a market where there's literally so much change? We're starting to see um your tradition traditional spinouts coming out, right? Where people who are 30 40omes from tier one, tier 2 firms leaving and starting their own thing. Um we're seeing kind of like seed and preede become extremely crowded with a lot of different players and then we're having people do multi-stage across, you know, competing with YC all the way to public companies. What do you think people should, you know, LP should be doing differently? I certainly think what Rodlin does differently is she's an investor where she is taking time to evaluate all the aspects of the opportunity, not just the financial component, but the people behind it. And to do that, it takes time. And to do that, it takes patience. And to do that it just takes a different perspective. Now for the industry at large because there's so much capital in the system. Some people don't have the luxury of doing that and that forces them to think about things in buckets where they have to put money in certain places because that's the mandate. I've sat on boards myself. Unfortunately, they were they were they were big boards, a pension fund board where we have uh portfolio allocation policy things that we have to do. So when you have to do that, you kind of have to do it. But there in lies the the challenge of the business. And if there was a way to restructure the industry such that there were more smaller investors to deploy that capital like have more fund the funds and more firms like Rodland then you could have a a wider distribution of where that capital is going. actually wrote a white paper on this and had an illustration that showed there's a ton of capital at the top of the system, but there's not enough people in the middle to distribute to all the different opportunities that they're in that are at the bottom. So, what ends up happening is the larger more established names end up soaking up all the capital and venture. And that's what happened in 2024. 70% of all the capital that was raised went to 30 different firms. And when you think about that, there's no way that talent is distributed among 30 different VC firms in the business. That logically doesn't make any sense. But it it's not an issue with those firms. It's an issue with how the industry is structured. You need more people in the middle to distribute it. You know, I think that this is I I think this is a great question, right? I So, if I if I take it from a perspect I think you're right. Right, Kevin. I think managers and GPS don't understand in general the resource constraints the on on the part of allocators that may lead to check the box thinking capital to the biggest players. you know, when you have billions of dollars to move, it's difficult for you to focus your limited resources on writing a $10 million check, right? Yeah. And you know, those are structural issues that won't get addressed um immediately. But I I would say two things for LPs. The one is there are knee-jerk negative reactions to things like fund of funds. I think because of what happened in the GFC where on the hedge fund side where no one was protected from maid off and fund of funds didn't do the work uh that they claimed that they were doing and that I think has infected the entire ecosystem in a way that's been detrimental and so I think one LP's rethinking that negative knee-jerk reaction yes there's an extra layer of fees but that's because you don't have the resources to feel the team to do And yet we all know that there's a world of opportunity outside of the 30 major venture funds that Kevin was just bringing up. I don't think this is just a venture issue. I think this is true systematically. So that would be one. Rethink this negative knee-jerk extra layer fees. I'm not paying for it. Sometimes you actually should pay for it because you are not equipped to actually execute on the smaller end of almost any market you're in where there's typically a lot of opportunity. I think the second thing I would say LPs need to do differently is they need to widen their operator a little bit. Um yes, it's true that you don't get criticized if you know one of the oligarchy firms loses you money. Um, but there's a lot more opportunity than what's safe and convenient. Uh, and challenge yourself to think a little bit differently than you have historically. Period. Yeah, that's amazing advice and and I think it definitely needs to be, you know, people need to widen their uh, perspectives as you mentioned um because there's true alpha out there and an opportunity. Um, kind of changing gears, uh, Kevin, where do you I I assume I know that your answer, but want to know some details behind it. Uh, what trends do you see in venture capital in 2025 and beyond? And, you know, are you overly optimistic or bearish on it over these next this next decade? The future of venture capital to me isn't an industry like a technology that's going to change everything. I think the future of venture capital is a wider representation of talent and founders that are in the market that are going to bring new ideas and new applications to technologies that uh need to be applied in different markets and in different ways. Mhm. And I was listening to a podcast of a guy who said that he was talking about this in the cruise industry and very random cruise industry. But the reason why certain of those cruises go really really well is because of the diversity of staff that they have on board and the net that net uh NPS scores where people are really really high and things are just going really really well. But it had a lot to do with who was on the ship. So I think as if the VC industry is a ship who's coming onto the ship is what's going to make that better. And I think technology is what's pushing that forward and making it um we'll see that in 10 years be a totally different landscape hopefully. I don't predict the future. We can be optimistic. Well, you you do you do in a bit and who you like choose to partner with. That's predicting a little bit of future. I'll push you. I'll push back on that. Okay. So if I use the metaphor uh I choose which cruise lines I will go on but um you know I I think it's interesting right because yes I think AI is going to be a gamecher and we can only begin to imagine the impact it will have across all industries but you know one of the things as an investor I noticed on some level like technology is everything. Yeah. And what that has led me to is actually especially since I've been really exposed to a lot of venture um because because I backed Kevin therefore every aspiring venture fund is is approaching us. But I have to tell you what it has led me to is thinking more about uh the bricks and mortar businesses as opportunities as well. Right? Because I think the herd is, you know, I listen, I I just remember all I I I remember this venture fund who was doing AI who just raised I don't know so much money so quickly before I could even do diligence, you know, I just like ah this is a bubble, right? There's going to be a lot of junk in here because people are just throwing money at it. That again to the slight contrarian nature here, the investments I've made thus far are already technology exposure. Um, and so I am deliberately looking for what I call basic businesses, right? Bricks and mortar, things that need to happen in the real world as well. Yes, technology will have an impact. Yes, technology may make things more efficient. Um, but we're far off from technology being a solution for everything. And I think that again to be a little bit different than where the herd goes, is I'm paying attention to those kinds of opportunities, especially in the investments I make with independent sponsors. I appreciate that perspective. I might push back a little bit on that because of my bias, but like I I appreciate that perspective. Um I want to I'd be remissed if I didn't have you both talk about something that I think is really important. um if you're VC manager, growth manager, or just in private markets overall is how do you develop and cultivate strong relationships with allocators and LPs um when there's so much noise today? So many more firms. I got this crazy stat um that uh from one of our prior guests um Megan from uh uh Altameter um and it basically was like there are more venture funds than franchises. It might have been all privates but I think it was venture funds than uh McDonald's franchises. And so that's insane. Yes. Um but that also shows that it's become mainstream a bit and a lot of people are in the market. So how do you actually differentiate yourself and more importantly how do you have these strong relationships? Like Kevin, when we were talking kind of in a pre-call, you you spoke about the importance of like being intentional with relationships. So for our emerging managers listening, how do you actually do that when there's so much noise and so much competition? I I'd say something very simple. Every single time you reach out to someone, you don't have to ask for a meeting. And I think that people consider that a wasted effort if they don't. I strongly diff beg to differ on that. I would say about 70% of my outreach is just sending people follow-ups and updates and interesting things that I'm seeing on a daily basis. And the other 30% it might be I'm asking for someone to meet with me. But that's the relationship building component of this is that's number one. And number two, everyone says this, but how do you add value to that relationship? So when I'm pre-planning for meetings for the day, I'm always thinking, man, what can I bring to the table that's going to make this worth their time? And I will postpone reaching out to someone until I can figure that out. M this business is such a marathon and people forget that it takes 18 months to build a really good relationship with someone. And Roin and I met back in May of 2023. So now we're almost 2 years into this and we have this amazing relationship. But that took time to develop. And I take 10 or 15 minute calls with people all the time that reject Sarak Ventures, our firm. And I tell them, I've been in this business long enough to know that it's a relationship game. And I'd love to keep you in the loop on what we're what we're building for the next four or five years until we get the fund three. That stuff just doesn't happen overnight. The immediiacy of needing things now certainly is important, but you got to be building for fund three and beyond. And those relationships take longer because there's a lot more competition. So to the to the extent that the emerging managers can think like that, I think that differentiates them from others in the market a little bit. I think I think that's correct. I think this is a long game and emerging managers need to approach it as such. I also think emerging managers need to be a little bit more realistic in their expectation of what is possible and understand that the counterparty has their own issues that they're managing through. Uh and when we think about relationship building, what I have found, you know, I am not one of those people who does well going to 2,000 people conferences and you know introducing myself to people I you know but I have found that the best relationships are developed when there is a warm introduction right so full circling back to your network and developing your network it's those kinds of personal connections me saying hey Kevin meet this person Kevin saying hey meet this person that leads to a certain level of intimacy and the prospect of a building a long-term relationship because it has nothing to do with a transaction that's immediate. Yeah. And you will be disappointed along the way, but you have to have the attitude that again these are relationships, not just prospects. And each um individual or entity has its own horizon that may not fit yours and you're just going to have to be patient. I think the other thing I would add because you know people think I'm an extrovert. I'm not. I'm quite introverted. I I I people exhaust me, not energize me. But what I realized in this building your network and cultivating a network, what I always used to do and what I still do is do I want to spend time with you, not what can you do for me or what I can do for you. And so if you find people as you progress and as you find people that you are sympotico with, maintain those because you they should be in your hundred, right? that the criteria of how they're in your hundred because it's not work. It's natural, right? You're developing natural friendships uh because there's some connection or bond. And whether or not you'll be useful to each other in the future, trust me, you will it it will happen. But that can be one way for you to sort of qualify who you spend time with um and who you you invest in in terms of building long-term relationship. Well, I I don't think there's any better way we could we could end the pod with the that sage advice from both of you. Um, so I want to thank both of you, Kevin and Roslin, for being on the podcast today and um I'm sure we'll we'll have in our our notes uh you guys socials so people can get connected to you. So, really appreciate you guys being on today. Thank you for having us, Ernest. My pleasure. Thank you so much, Ernest. No problem. See you later, alligator.
