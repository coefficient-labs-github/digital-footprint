    "transcript": "If the person that I'm investing in doesn't ask for a reference from me, that's a really bad sign. There are a lot of in our industry. I mean, for one of my companies, they just raised a series A. Part of that A- round was to take out an existing investor. That was a huge negative force on the company and a massive energy drain on the founder. It was terrible, man. It was such a negative founders out there like due diligence on your investors prior to taking money from them. What's up, everyone? Welcome to another episode of Demo Day, the podcast for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists where we demystify the culture of joining one of the top accelerators, incubators or VC funds from around the world. I'm your host Sean Goldbound from Coefficient Labs and on today's episode we interview Jeff Bokean from Okopy Ventures. Without further ado, let's get into demo day. [Music] Jeff, thank you so much for joining us today on Demo Day. Yeah, I'm psyched to be here, Sean. Thanks so much. So, Jeeoff, one of my, you know, favorite things about our last conversation was, uh, you know, listening to sort of your core key values of yourself and the, you know, things that you mentioned that were so important to you was number one, lead by example, and number two, have a positive attitude. And uh having known you now for a couple years, you know, you just you emanate that positive attitude. Jen came in the room and I was like, \"God, Jeff's a really nice guy.\" And I just want to say it's really great to have you here. We appreciate you and I'm excited for today's episode. Thank you. Well, I uh appreciate that and I love the positive attitude. It's a mantra of mine even within my family. Yeah, it's pretty fun. I have uh four kids and my youngest uh there was a stretch one summer where or last summer we ran out of like things to do for the summer with like scheduled camps or whatever. So we had camp daddy one week and that's cool. Tell me more about that. Yeah. Well, it was fun. Well, we did all kinds of like things with with my kid for the week and uh where I took a lot of time off and my uh some of my older kids helped out. But we made camp t-shirts and positive attitude. We wrote that was the camp that was the camp motto. Cam positivity. Yeah. So around the neck of the shirt it said positive attitude and then the back of the shirt said start with yes which is our another family motto. We lean forward, lean into things, start with yes. Yeah. I love it. So let's let's peel the onion back a little because I think that you know um sometimes people, especially myself included, the quote unquote like positivity, the optimism almost like you know it's just like who I am who you are in that way. But, you know, I'm sure you and I both have had moments of hardship. We've had moments where it's like, I don't want to be positive and I don't feel like everything's great and you have tragedies like, you know, the Palisades fires. You have all of these, you know, roadblocks that hit you in the face. And so, you know, keeping that as a steady beat of the drum is something that you have to work on. It it's it's like a muscle that you're, you know, growing. Why is it important just in life to have a yes first attitude, to have a positive first attitude? What can people that maybe that doesn't come as natural to them understand that maybe they don't see? I mean, not that I've got it all figured out, but I think that when you start with yes, you are open to all the possibilities and at least have a very open mind about uh what can happen. So, obviously in the venture capital space or in entrepreneurship, you know, you're looking to create new opportunities. That's how big businesses and uh are created is when you are finding an opportunity that others haven't seen yet. So if you're kind of leaning back, arms crossed, you're kind of I'm not so sure, you don't see the doors that are actually probably open that in front of you. Uh so you you need to start with that. Um it's it's kind of ironic in venture that you know I start with yes, but I say no 99.99% of the time, which is a little frustrating to me actually. Uh but you know because I look at a thousand deals a month and I'll do like maybe one. So, but I always to take to start reading the uh you know the pitch or to engage with a founder, you have to start leaning in and you have to start with the belief and then maybe from there you're knocking it down like well why doesn't this work? But you have to start with like what are all the possibilities what can really happen and I think it's just critical for founders to always when you are have that positive view that you can find windows and angles that others are maybe not seeing and you can go for it. Now, you know, you were talking about how it's a staple for you to teach this to your children, keep it within the family, let them know about it. A lot of people don't have those parents that are like, you know, so, you know, confident in the opportunities of the world. In fact, so many are more like you shouldn't do that or you can't do that. Is that something that came from your parents? And is that natural to you that it's always been that way or is it something that over time you're like this is how I want to do it and I want to pass this down to my family? Yeah, that's interesting. I uh I don't know if it was for my parents so much or they encouraged me to take risks and try things and try new things and gave me a lot of flexibility and rope but I think for me it was um I things have worked out quite well for me without I followed kind of a weird path and it wasn't pre uh it wasn't all set up for me you know I kind of didn't go through things in a planned sequential way I was kind of open to opportunities and and things worked out I mean I even got into venture capital kind of on accident. I I wasn't trying to be a VC. Yeah. You were trying to get a job at a startup in London. Right. Right. Right. And then it turned into a venture capital job. So, but but it's like I things like that have worked out when you're open to opportunities and and you know being positive. And to be honest, people like interacting with other positive people. And you know, business, especially venture capital, but even just within business, it it's a uh people get to self- select who they want to work with, who they want to hire. And people want to be around other positive people. And I think it just it it creates more opportunities for you when you are more positive. Yeah. Aside from seeing the opportunities, like people want to pull you in. They want that positive energy. And it's a plus. I I don't know, to be honest. I'm not that like uh intentional about it, I guess. Um as much as you know, I just try to be that way. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think that's a a good segue cuz I never really got that to ask you this in our last conversation, but like what's a normal week like? You know, what's a normal week like both for Jeff individually and you know, maybe for people that are like what the hell do venture capitalists do every week? How would you describe a typical week as a VC and maybe even in your personal world? Yeah, so I spend largely it's broken into thirds. Okay. Spend about a third of my time working with our existing portfolio companies. So I'm on the board of a lot of different companies that we've invested in. Um, and whether it's board meetings formally or just trying to help uh make a uh business introduction uh with a customer for one of our portfolio companies for somebody doing helping interview uh a potential senior manager for um one of the roles in one of our portfolio companies like I I will do that sort of stuff every day. Um or interacting with fellow investors um who are in invested in the company. am I drive up here today? Like that's a whole car ride was talking to fellow investors in one of our portfolio. You're welcome. You're welcome. I knew you I knew you needed to catch up with everyone. Make the time. So a third is on portfolio. A third is looking at new deals. Okay. And um maybe a little bit more than that actually, but at least a third where I'm looking at new opportunities, whether it's getting formally pitched by founders, just reading through uh decks that I'm getting access to. And then the other third is a combo of generating deal flow. So meeting with people like you to uh or fellow VCs or other entrepreneurs who maybe they don't have an active opportunity, but I'm just spending time with them because I'm I think all right, hey, here's somebody who's really connected. Someday they might introduce something great to me. Yeah. So this generating deal flow in that last third and you know it's like attending parties and events or whatever it may be, you know, in the entrepreneurial community. um or just texting with people. Hey, you know, what have you looked at recently that's exciting? What should I be investing in? Um and uh then spending time with some of that networking is actually with investors too. So investors for myself. So like our money doesn't like I don't have a money tree in my backyard. I wish I did, but like I need to raise money too. It's it's generally generally more episodic where we raise every 3 to four years. But um in those fundraising years, I'm spending a lot of time you meeting with investors trying to get them to invest into our new funds. What's one thing you've learned over the years about maintaining those sorts of relationships? Later in the podcast, I want to ask a little bit more about what you look for in LPS, right? Not just in startups, but in those sorts of relationships, but you know, when it comes to maintaining those sorts of relationships, what's been something you've learned over the years that's helped you down the road? you know, maybe early in your career it wasn't so clear, but now that you've you've been in it, what's a learning you've taken away in just the concept of maintaining relationships? Yeah, that frequency really matters. So, you know, you can have a great relationship with somebody and then if you don't talk to them for 3 years, then you ping them out of the blue again. Like, it's yes, you can often pick up where you left off, but I think it's better to have like lots of little touches along the way. So that's another thing I try to be somewhat more deliberate about when we get some really great portfolio news for example like I will forward it with a personal note to all of my investors saying hey this happened and then it gives a chance to dialogue about something else and if I do that at least twice a year of course we do a newsletter but that goes out to everybody and it's not personalized but if I have a chance to have a personal touch point or maybe it's just a text message and it can even be about like oh I know this person is a Philadelphia Eagles fan like I'm going to text them congrats in the Super win or whatever it is. But those little touch points really matter. And I I think that's probably the most important thing that I found. Now, quantity over quality sometimes. Some people listening may be like, \"Well, yeah, Jeeoff, obviously you should keep in touch and you should be frequent, but how do you do it? Sometimes I forget or sometimes like it's just not top of mind.\" Um, they may be wondering like what's your methodology? like it come natural and you're just like, \"Oh, I should have hit this person up.\" Or do you have to schedule time for yourself or kind of remind yourself to sit down? What would your actual uh methodology be when it comes to those quick little pings or those frequency touch points? I mean, to be honest, I probably should schedule it more and be more deliberate about it. Um it's more authentic just like you you it's almost like a feeling of oh I should hit this person up or talk to them or if I'm in there at the city or if I'm traveling around or something happens like I I try to you know be open to reminding people like hey I'm in town I mean last night like I was up in the bass area which I'm not up there too often. Yeah. And I pinged a guy who you know I'm is a longtime friend who uh I've done stuff with over time and um I was like oh yeah I should ping ping this person you So sometimes when I'm in town it it's a little bit more um serendipitous but which isn't a great strategy. No, totally. I always be open to that. But for me, like the formal way of doing it is just when I people love getting good news and especially people that have backed you like our investors like they're they're not only backing me but they they like to hear about the portfolio companies and it's a long game like they can put in capital with us and they don't they often don't see it for like if they put in a million bucks with us they may not get that money like get the beginnings of returning that capital for five, six, seven years. Wow. And then by the time they fully are out of the fund, it could be 10 to 12 years. So it's a long game. So you need to uh kind of keep people warm and reminded that of why they made the investment and how things are going. Giving good news is always the most fun, but sometimes we have to give bad news. And so from the perspective of both founders listening to this that are, you know, maybe the quarter's been rough, maybe they had to let someone go or they left and got recruited out, but what's the right way or what's a a spectrum of right that you want to see from founders when bad news needs to be delivered? In your opinion, is there a difference between the right way to do it and the wrong way to do it? Well, the wrong way to do it is is wait and and delay bad news. I mean, honestly, that I'd mentioned that car ride up. That car ride was because the founder had not updated people in 5 months and there wasn't great news along the way. And people suspect that because people fill the void of not hearing good news, they're assuming the worst. And then then things start to spiral out of control. They get a lack of confidence in the management team, which that kind of compounds itself down the line. It's going to it's going to be harder for this founder should he need to go back and raise more money. The existing investors aren't going to be dying to give it to him because now like they have this the seeds of doubt like well sewed at this point like I'm not so sure about this guy and then when I've reached out to him to see how things are going he's kind of not really getting back to me or getting back with nothing much. So I'm assuming the worst. So I I I think it's best to pull bad news forward early and not necessarily to spin it as like oh this is bad but everything's going to be great. I think it let deliver the bad news and then say what you're doing about it and even if you don't know what you're going to do about it is going to be right at least lay out a plan. U but I think you know letting people know early and then laying out the game plan for how you're going to address it and then say I'm going to check back in with you couple you know two three months later and let you know how we've been doing and if we're on track to getting things back where we need to be. But I think that you know laying it out there early with a clear plan is is key. laying out early, have a clear plan, check in frequently with postcommunication, like those three thing combo when you've got some back and then asking for help. Honestly, I think that's a big part of it, too. It's like, hey, I've run into this problem. Like, we're struggling here. This is my plan. Give me some feedback. If if you think that's right, or if you think you can help me execute this plan, let me know. Wow, that's a great extra piece of advice because then if you're giving the bad news early enough, then you're able to almost like empower people to help you early in that journey to write the ship. But if you deliver it at the very end, it's like, dude, why didn't you come and talk to me a couple months ago about it? Yeah. I mean, look, the the startup process is a a whole collaborative process. I mean from the beginning yes you are receiving money from investors but like they are standing beside you with their it may be with their checkbook but a lot of people are willing to help beyond that as well. So they want to they are you know backing those teams more than just with the money and it's even an emotional investment too like they've you know they're they're in there with you. So they want to be able to help so sharing in the pain and you know helping people get through it if they can. What market trends are you excited about right now, if any at all? And I I'm also curious like with a a preliminary follow-up question, which is like is it tough for you to allow yourself to get excited about industries outside of your wheelhouse? You know, it's sort of like if if like you love startups and investing, but it's your job dayto-day. Um what are you excited about these days? And does it fit within, you know, what you're currently doing or has that been a an obstacle over time? I've been super excited about what's happening with AI, of course, people going to talk about AI, but what I like most about AI as a seed investor is that our we don't have to put a huge amount of money into companies to see if there we can get some real traction early. So the AI tools are just making startups more efficient. So I think that ultimately it's going to allow us to take have more shots on goal at successes and so sometimes we will write one or two checks into a company we may not even really feel like we've figured out if they've gotten there yet and we've the companies have had to consume a fair amount of capital to get to that point. I think we're pulling forward is their product market fit sooner with the AI tools because you're not having to invest so much capital and time to get to that point. So I'm really excited about that. So we can test a lot of new verticals and and it's quicker to launch products to market. So the p the pace uh is what I'm excited about and just seeing a lot of opportunities um especially in areas where there are large data sets that have been difficult to work with in the past and it's creating new opportunities there in all types of verticals. So, um, you know, we're not I'm not like, oh, we only I I'm not excited just about cyber security or just about fintech or wherever it may be, but I think there are lots of verticals that have haven't been disrupted yet that people can really go after now with not a lot of capital. And now how and if you have a structure in your head or a framework, but with how quickly things are moving, how do you evaluate potential opportunity when like everyone's, oh, it's this and AI and it's this and AI and it's this and AI and like everyone's coming at you with that kind of this is my carrot and this, you know, it's like this is my I've got the these two things, but um there's so much more now coming in. There's more noise, there's more people, ton more noise, right? How do you evaluate the and kind of differentiate between especially at the seed stage when it's it's early like you don't have that much data yet? Yeah, you're 100% right and I see a lot I'm so yes I'm seeing more opportunities but I'm seeing more of the same things. So then ultimately it's like you either are thinking gosh am I picking the right horse here? There's so many opportunities all going after the same I I believe in the problem area. I'm hoping I'm picking the right team. you don't love being in that situation because who knows if you're picking the right team um which is hard. So what we really look for or what I really look for in particular is um this kind of earned insight that a founder will have. Um so the techn is great but it's kind of a commodity and everybody's got it. So what really differentiates the market opportunity for me or the business opportunity is the founder or the founding team. Do they have the earned insight in that? there's typically a vertical market they're going after whether it's um you know in the payment space or in the insurance industry or whatever but have they worked in that industry or worked adjacent to that industry where they understand the customer painoint exceptionally well they understand the tech ecosystem that their technology is going to integrate within or replace. Do they understand the workflows of those users extremely well to understand what to build and then how people how they're going to have a product that will delight those customers and then do they understand the buying like the selling process or the the consumer buying process or the way to sell that product to the customers. Um a great product's awesome but by itself it's not all that useful if it can't be actually sold and delivered and maintained with a customer. So understanding and and it if you don't understand the industry and the vertical very well you are probably going to fail on the go to market side and the product support side even if you have an amazing product and then also with that insight typically comes relationships which are just so key. I mean AI by itself great but like no one wants to interact with an AI by itself like people like doing business with other people and people that they like and people with positive attitudes. Uh so do they have relationships where they have a running start where they can get into customers early, develop strategic partnerships early and channel partners for distribution and and ultimately for hiring. It's like is this a manager who can or a founder who can recruit the relevant people who also have relevant domain experience um with the kind of credibility where someone's going to be like, \"Yeah, I'm going to join that startup because this person knows exactly what they're doing. They know my space. they have the right product and this is going to be a huge company someday. So there it's it's that with that core of earned insight like that can be the kind of uh center of gravity I guess to make all those other things happen and spin around for recruitment customer acquisition knowing what product to build all those things but that c that earned insight of the founder is key. Last episode, uh, we had TX Zoo over from Fica Ventures on the show, and he was telling us this really cool story about how, uh, I believe they brought in a firm. I I'm I'm pretty sure it was from outside that analyzed all of their most successful investments to try to, uh, build some kind of um, signal, like what are the signals, right? And it's like, okay, is this a repeat founder? Has the founder had another exit in the past? um you know like all these different little um uh indicators and keys. And they found that the pattern the only pattern that they could see amongst their top 1 percentile or their top top startups was the speed at which founders responded to emails and that the single I love like most um linear pattern was responsiveness. Yeah. and that on the flip side, their least um successful were the ones that were least responsive or waited to send that email. And I found that fascinating. That is I was wondering in your, you know, in your world, well, you may not necessarily have a team that like analyzed it. When you kind of think about like your good investments versus your great ones or the ones that you are so excited about, is there traits that you've seen or are there patterns that you've seen that differentiate the good from the great not even the bad from the the bad, but you know in that kind of head-to-head arena? What are the things that really like drive the greatest of your portfolio companies forward? Yeah, for me it was the found in my best deals. where the founder responds to emails quickly. I I want to go back and look to that actually. Now you said that it's like I and I'm going to start using that as I thank UTX uh for that. Um but um uh for me it's been their when you started to say responsiveness. I was going to say to customers and the market, but in particular like really listening to customers and um especially early on. So when founders, you have to have a lot of conviction into what you're doing. But if you have too much conviction, you might be missing the biggest opportunity when you just think you're right. And you need to you need to you don't want to listen to everybody because not everyone's opinion is equal. But for a number of my best investments, the the kind of core business and the main business revenue driver wasn't it was a derivative of the original product or idea. It wasn't like the first thing, but then once they got into it, they realized like, oh, actually, we need to move over into this slightly adjacent space because a customer would say, \"Hey, I love what you're doing, but if it could do this, like it would really be amazing.\" And then what they found is that like the that doing the this is the part that re that was common with a lot of other customers and that was the real value driver going forward and a way to really differentiate. And so having that flexibility and adaptability early on where it's like it's this, you know, strong conviction lightly held where it's like, all right, yes, I firmly believe this, but I got to hear from customers once I start engaging and really listen and it's like, oh, maybe we should be doing this and and move. It's not it's not a complete pivot. it's more like a like slight turn, but those are the ones that have worked out the best where uh whether it's a business model tweak, maybe it's they lean into a feature that um so you know, one of my best investments was Duo Security, which pioneered two-factor authentication. Wow. They end up getting bought by CIS from bought by Cisco for three billion and you I was in there very lucky as with writing the very first check. Wow. And but like what they were doing originally and doing the two-factor authentication um they were able to pivot. They started more as a it probably goes into too much detail the beginning of this whole thing but it started more as like this enterprise approach and then what they realized was that uh for like enterprise cyber security almost but what they realized was having more endpoint access and making it easy for companies to use um and a much lighter product early on where it's like hey we're just going to provide a tool that will let you get access to the accounts allowed it to proliferate throughout the organization much more quickly as oosed to enterprise saying like oh I don't want this big heavy system that I need like tops down and it being kind of a bottoms up product and it scaled really rapidly. How do you balance and this could be both from an investor perspective so I let's do it from the investor perspective. How do you balance your datadriven analysis sort of that like show me the numbers, show like I I I'm a lo I'm an investor so I need to understand the logic of the data versus your intuition like I just I know it. I feel like this is where it's going. Has that ever been a challenge for you? Is that something that you think is a superpower of yours? what what's the what's the spread in in that um you know in that space of data versus intuition? Have you developed any sort of POV on that? Yeah, unfortunately at the seed stage we need to be a little bit more intu intuition focused because there's not a lot of data. There's some data but sometimes you can really be misled by that early data. Um you you need I mean so for a startup to really get big it needs they need to have a repeatable and scalable sales model and and a product that can be enjoyed by a lot of people a lot of potential customers. You can have a product that's killing it for one really large customer which is fant like I'm I have a startup right now which I've moved forward. I'm I'm I did the preede. I I'm just leading I led the seed round last week and it's a I'm still a little nervous about it in that like they only have a handful of customers. They're crushing it with these customers who are big Fortune 100 customers and they're largely in one vertical market. The company is called Credos AI and um they have some really large telecommunications customers, T-Mobile, Verizon, US Cellular which is awesome, huge customers and their product is doing a great job for these customers but you know can they break out of that vertical can they have get repeat that product with other companies other big companies who are solving a similar problem it's it's mainly around collecting late payments from customers in any given month like 20% of Verizon's customers don't pay their bill or at least are late, which maybe is understandable. It's kind of the US population. Yeah. And and they have tens of millions of customers, so chasing all these late payers. It well, one, it's a lot of money that's out there. And two, it's it's not it's inefficient to go after these people. So, Critos has a tool for that that leverages data and uh rapid AB testing with messaging. And it's it's pretty cool what they do, but it's like, wow, can they do this in other verticals? Um I I get nervous about so when I'm invested in obviously I wrote the check and we're moving forward. So I have enough conviction. Yeah. That that yes the product's working for these three big customers and I'm seeing in their sales pipeline interest in other verticals where people are saying yes I have the same problem um and they want it solved as well. So I think it's going to work out. Yeah. Yeah. But most of the time I'd prefer to see a situation where we have data with lots of different customers where lots of people are enjoying it and they've been able to demonstrate a repeatable scalable sales process but at the seed stage you typically will have just a handful of customers and you need to kind of take the leap like can this be repeated uh or not and we'll see like I love bringing VCs onto the show that started off as entrepreneurs you know early exeacts at big companies but they've been in the startup world and now they've And on the other side of the, you know, of the coin, when it comes to fundraising, what are some of the common mistakes that you see founders making? Like when when just a a general statement, general question, but what are some of the easy lowhanging fruit things that you're like, man, if they would just get this part right, it would help them so much more along the way. Is what are some common mistakes that you see founders make during fundraising process? The first two are some sound somewhat contradictory. one is you're always fundraising. So kind of you need to bear that in mind that you need to uh have tight messaging about what you're doing with people anytime anytime you're engaged with prospective investors even when you're not fundraising. You need to have in in your mind that you you effectively kind of are have this story like here's what I do. This is why it's important. Here's where we're at. Here's some like nuggets of traction or reasons to be interested. And then just kind of always lead with that in those conversations where where you're kind of framing for people like who are you? What are you doing? And and why should I be interested? Even if you're not raising. So you're always kind of doing that. Okay. And some founders like they'll engage with people when they're like I'm not in fundraising mode and they just start talking about random stuff and they're kind of missing an opportunity to frame in the investor's mind like this. Oh yeah, like this person's doing something that's really cool. They have some traction. I want to keep in touch with them and stay on. So they're they're kept warm. So when the founder is actually going to come to market, that person's gonna be very receptive to raising. There was a great founder. I'll do a shout out to um Nick Halverson at Ocfolio companies. But he did a great job of this. I attracted him for like two years with him, you know, he was kind of letting me know what he was doing, give me little nuggets of success, and we ended up leading a seed round, and they just closed on an A round, uh, $6 million A round at the end of last year, and they're ripping as a business. They're doing awesome. But he did a great job of of, you know, fundraising when I wasn't really ready to invest. I like, you guys are too early. But every time he'd reach out, he he did a good job of keeping me warm. And then when he was ready, we went for it. And I was I was very, you know, psyched to move forward with him. So he he did a good job of raising when he wasn't really raising. And I think other founders can and should do that. Now, the part that's contradictory is when where I see people fail is they they're not ready when they are actually fundraising. They kind of halfass it. What does that mean to you? To me, so they so they'll do like a maybe a crappy pitch deck. Maybe they won't even have a pitch deck. They'll just have they'll start sending around some emails. Hey, we're raising. We're going to raise, but they haven't really thought through all of the they're not they're not ready to engage with investors in a deep way. So, when once investors start probing like, \"Hey, well, let's check out your uh financial model. Like, how are you going to spend this three million bucks?\" And they're like, \"Ah, I don't really have a model. We'll get back to you on that.\" Um uh can I see some customer traction? Like, what's happening with with what you guys have done in the last 12 months? They're like, \"We don't really have metrics. Um, I'll get you something later.\" And you kind of lose that momentum. So, when you are going to actually formally start fundraising, like have your together. Start you just think in your head or talk to some friendly V, whether it's VCs or co-investors or angels or just your own team. It's like, if we were going to invest in our business, what would we want to know? And um have have some information ready. You don't need this massive data room, but have like some of the basics in place where you can start to engage in a diligence process because this is a momentum play. The fund like once you are going it it's kind of a a momentum process where you can't really drag it out because what founders need to remember is that aside from VCs generally having short attention spans like we're getting hit by people with new ideas multiple times every day. So there's always some new shiny object to potentially chase. So once you are engaged with somebody, you need to like really take advantage of that moment and try to seal the deal as quickly as you can. And if you don't have your together because you're going to start taking meetings and taking meetings and your time's going to get spread out pitching all the time. But if you blow it on the follow-up, it's all going to be a waste. So, and that's where I see founders mess it up a lot is they're just not ready for the followup and it think it just kind of never happens because the VCs end up getting pulled into other opportunities. Yeah. I wonder if that's where part of what TX was saying of that responsiveness that like when people are very responsive, it keeps you on that hook. you're like, \"Oh, there like the ping pong game is still going and the lack of it is like, oh, I've got all these other people that are going to, you know, be more attentive, more resp I got to keep moving.\" And so I I could totally see how that plays, you know, a role in it. Um, what are your non-negotiables? Meaning like they don't have to be built into the contract. They could just be more personality driven or spiritually driven or whatnot, but like what are your non-negotiables? It doesn't matter how good the investment is. It's just like it doesn't sit right with you, if any at all. Well, for us as a firm, part of our strategy is um we we're looking for capital efficient businesses generally. So, we're not going to go into deals where it's like we need to raise $200 million to for this to be successful. Like, if some founders focused on needing to raise a huge sum, we just don't even, you know, like that one's not for us. Like, we're going to end up with a tiny little piece of ownership in this company and we we're not really we don't want to go down that path. Um, and it's just not a great fit for us. But I I think on the on the personal side, so some of it is, you know, you kind of know it when you see it, but when you're interacting with somebody and um they think they've got it figured out and they're kind of combative. So when you're asking questions about their business and they're just really defensive out of the gate about everything, that's pro there's probably some real core insecurity there that is just going to be the business is probably going to be doomed. Like that founder is just not going to get to a successful point if they're very defensive out of the gate about everything that they're doing. And to my prior point about like companies where we've had the best success is when they're the founder was really open to listening and being, you know, having those strong convictions lightly held where it's like, all right, hey, I'm willing to be slightly wrong, you know, wrong a bit on this and I change directions. But if you find a founder that feels like they've got it all figured out, those are the ones where I, you know, I'm ending the the Zoom or the meeting ASAP. Yeah. And when you see in those questions, you're like, \"No, I just I can't even I don't want to work with this person going forward longer term.\" Um because it it's startups are hard. You're going to have lots of hard conversations. No one's got it all figured out. We're we're we're operating in this whole realm of uncertainty. if you think you you know all the answers like you're deliluding yourself and that's going to be uh a no no. Um yeah, now sometimes and now I'm sure it's very case by case, but sometimes I imagine that that comes because it's like a learned behavior early on. You're like my my older brother always, you know, and so I've got to explain why my thing is right or like they don't get it or something. And it's almost like eventually becomes this blind spot of theirs because they're so in it and they almost like can't read the like emotional cues. So, you know, let's like use your own your own children as a mentoring uh opportunity here. How would you describe to them like like how do you help someone spot that quality in themselves? Like you know, you care about it's your kid. you want him to understand. And so, how can you help someone spot that? And is there anything you think they can do or is it like you've just, you know, it's kind of like that's a personality trait that I've real I I don't want to work with, but in if you were to give advice to someone or you were to try to help them see that blind spot. Anything come to mind of like how you would help them understand why that's an issue and how they can maybe improve upon it? I don't really know. I mean, I think it's a hard question. It sure is. I mean, I I think a lot of it's through repetition. So where you know for for us we get to I'm kind of interviewing people all the time trying to understand their businesses and so forth. So you know there's some of that pattern recognition that you get. Um but I I think some of it's you know I know it's a cliche but about trusting your gut but you just get feelings about people sometimes and it's like you just really do have to listen to those. Um, I mean sometimes I I don't do as good of a job as I should do in that regard because I'm so in love with the idea or the product and it's you start to overlook things about the founder and um you just got to step back and remember no actually the founder is is 90% of the of the answer here or at least the driver of what's going to be successful and you you can't you can't cut corners around the founder. Now, switching the conversation over a little more towards the VC route and like more of like strategic, how do you source new opportunities? And have you found any strategies to be most effective? Some people go to events all the time. Some people, you know, work off their alumni network. Um, in your world, in your experience, what's been the best strategy for you? Obviously, you've got this, you know, almost never- ending positive attitude which makes and attracts people to want to work with you and be with you, but just in general, is there a specific way in which you found uh to find these amazing startups? There's so many VCs like how the freak do you find these people and so what's worked best for you and what advice do you have for others? This is something I feel like everyone needs everyone's trying to continuously improve on. So, I don't claim to have mastered it. I I definitely want to keep getting better. But what's been most effective for me is um not being passive about it. Uh so that means, you know, being proactive with conversations and reaching out to people. I mean, I get a lot of my deals from most of my the deals that we actually invest in are come from other VCs or from other founders that I've worked with in the past, founders and or board members. But usually I have to ask like sometimes they'll just people will send them over like hey you know I know you guys like these sorts of deals maybe this would be interesting to you. So, we'll do those. But I get a lot when I actually reach out to someone and I'll say, \"Hey,\" and sometimes I'll just be a little bit like cheeky about or whatever, but like, \"Hey, I got a million bucks burning hole in my pocket. Where should I put it?\" And I'll just send that text out to some people like or to other VCs. And it's a combo of later stage VCs that, you know, where their minimum check size is 5 10 million bucks or whatever and whereas I'm looking to do a million. So, we're not really competing. They may find they may know of a founder or someone maybe has left one of their existing portfolio companies and has spun something out and is doing something cool and like oh you should check that you should you go to that person and check them out. Or on the on the other side there are quite a few smaller VCs and we have quite a few here in Southern California who maybe only have a 510 million fund. They're writing quarter million dollar checks. They can't really lead necessarily a $3 million seed round. Um, so I'll reach out to them and be like, \"Hey guys, like you know, again, I got a million bucks burning a hole in my pocket. Like, what are you looking at? What's interesting? What should I invest into?\" And things come through that. But if you just kind of sit back and hope that the deals are going to start coming because even if you have planted the seeds and even if you are going to the parties and even if you are doing that, you have to remind people like try to get top of mind. I know you do all the advertising stuff, but you have to it is almost like that ad. You need that nudge to get people be like, \"Oh yeah, actually here's there's this one thing you might be interested.\" Yeah. Well, I mean, I think there we have this thought that's like, \"Oh, everyone must be thinking about me or like they know I'm the guy that does this, so of course they'll reach out and you almost like just forget that they have a thousand things going on and they just need a little, you know, a little touch.\" And I also love what you said, um, it reminds me like Jesse Sler, someone that I really look up to, talks about, you know, you have to like create your own luck. And like people are like, \"Oh, you know, oh, Jeff got lucky with this company or lucky with that.\" but they're not like seeing that it was like that message is what created that luck opportunity and um it's really you know if you want it go get it type of a mindset. Yeah 100%. So, one of my when I was helping run one of our portfolio companies, company called MPHI, one of my speaking of luck, one of my favorite interview questions I would just simply ask, are you lucky? And it was really interesting to hear the responses and you we obviously we tried to some of it was a positive attitude element, but we wanted to hire people who thought they were lucky. They might not have truly been lucky. Yes. But people who at least believe they were lucky because they're creating their own luck. typically they're proactive and you know we were a startupish company where we were growing quickly. We needed people who were comfortable with ambiguity. The the roles were changing all the time because the company was doubling in size every year and we needed people who felt like you know I'm creating my own luck. I can create opportunities forelves and I can yes I can create this new process in the company that no one's done before because it needs to be done or we just needed people who are proactive. But it was interesting. You'd hear great stories and or pe people who would say like, \"Oh, I'm I've had the worst luck and this this and that.\" Sometimes, look, sometimes you could have some recent bad luck. And it's legit bad luck. But hearing how people respond to the bad luck is then was the followup. It's like, \"All right, well, what did you do about that?\" Or like, \"How did you respond?\" And um it was just a great it was my favorite interview questions that and honestly it it that was a a key uh determinant for us. Yeah, at that time I was like, \"All right, should we hire this person or not?\" Yeah. My my favorite we I haven't done this question in a long time. I might need to bring it back, but um I would sit down with the candidate and I would say to them, \"You wake up in the morning and you have zero dollars in your bank account and you go, \"Oh my gosh, I have no money in my bank. How would you make your first $100?\" And so I had this one one kid, one one young man, freshman at USC, came in for an internship. He was dressed in a full suit. I'm like, \"Dude, it's a startup. Like, you don't need a suit here.\" And we sit down. I'm interviewing him. And I get to that question. I say, \"All right, TJ.\" Like, you wake up in the morning and your bank account is empty. All you have is the clothes on your back. How would you make your first $100? And he looks at me and he goes, \"I have the clothes on my back.\" And I go, \"Yeah, the clothes on your back. That's it.\" He goes, \"I'd go right to another job interview.\" Um when you think about um just like your journey in business, in entrepreneurship, in venture capital, uh mostly venture capital, uh you've had the chance to work at a huge like a bigger later stage VC fund, earlier stage, and I'm just curious like when you look back on it all, what were some or a just pivotal moment for you? like a pivotal moment or decision that then like significantly changed the direction or what you wanted to do? I mean, I know you like went to London and like you've had a lot of these big moments, but in VC in particular, was there one kind of fork in the road that like completely just changed the trajectory of like how your, you know, career turned out? Yeah, good question. I think there's kind of two of them. One was I I started um I was at Saffron Hill Ventures in London where I started and I moved to a different firm called Baronia where I end up staying for 11 years. But uh when I was at Barangia it was a merger of two a British company and an American company uh small firms and in that process the merger was a little bit contentious and messy and basically a lot of the people in the British office quit. So I was in that London office and it was like me and couple people left and they had a portfolio of 30 40 companies. They had capital that they had to deploy on a certain schedule and I was like 27 years old and one of the last people standing and they're like well I guess you're now on like these 10 boards and we need to get these deals done and go for it. And I, you know, felt like holy my god like I'm not sure I'm ready for this. And it was one of these I just got an opportunity really that that created at that point, but I really leaned into it and embraced it and tried to make the most of it and be the, you know, do the best that I possibly could. But that accelerated my uh I was basically doing stuff at an age I probably shouldn't have been doing, but I leaned into it and went for it. And that really set me up to do um you know I think to have a solid venture career from there and I think to become a a good board member early. So for some VCs they're you know they maybe don't get board opportunities till later in their career but I was instantly on a bunch in my 20s and I wasn't awesome at that time. I was getting better. I I'm still getting better I like to think. But that was a huge help where I just was given a lot of responsibility early on that maybe I wasn't probably truly ready for but there was no one else to do it. And I'm really grateful you know for having had that chance at Beeria. That was number one. And then two is also Beher related. When I left Beeria I I I left it to help run my portfolio company MPHI which is a consumer electronics company. It was one of my investments. Um in 2010 I invested into it. It was doing you know barely anything in revenue. And then in the next three years went from zero to 50 million or nearly zero but you know call a couple million to 50 million in revenue. The two founders asked me to come on board to help run it at one of the board meetings and I was a you know Baron a board member at that time and that was a big decision for me where I I left the VC side of the table and went to the operator side of the table and I helped run MPHI then for the next three years we went from 50 to 250 million in revenue and then we sold it to a public company called Zag. But like that was a big decision for me because it it took me off the venture path. Yeah. So I left the firm, you know, it was it was a friend, you know, friendly departure and I still was on the board of a number of the Beeria companies after I left. But it was a hard decision to leave cuz I loved that team that I was working with at Beeria. Um you're still early at that like you're not full, you know, you're not 35, 40, 45. You're like should I is this the right decision for me at that point? Wow. Yeah. So I left. Well, at that point I was actually I had had turned 40 at that point. So, I've been at Ber for a lap. There we go. We're back. We're back. So, I I was but I was at this decision where I'm like, man, I actually have a really great thing going here with B&G. I love the team. We're doing well as a firm, but I've always wanted to work at a startup. You I was kind of an accident. I didn't mean to be a VC as it was. I wanted to be at a startup and MPHI was crushing it. I liked the founders a lot. It it was a super fun company to work with. It was a rocket ship and it was and it got me back to Southern California which all those things I wanted to do but I was leaving a lot on the table literally um in leaving Baronia which you know was expensive to leave um but it was a different career move which you know and I had you know a a great learning experience with MPHI and you know we got a good outcome there and um now I'm back on the VC side of the table so things worked out for me to get back here but it was and I'd like to think I'm a much better investor now for having had those three years of that intense grind at MPHI going from that 50 million to 250 million in revenue. We went from like 50 employees to 320 became a global business. You know that was um that was a ton of work. Um but I learned so so much from it and got most of these white hairs from it. But it it was it was cool. I'm curious like have have you witnessed your own investment strategy evolve over time or do you find that you know the steady beat of the drum the chop wood carry water mentality um has carried you well and I ask it more from the context of I feel like ventures changed a lot startups have changed a lot there was COVID came then there was the postcoavid bit of a recession now we're coming back and like just things are moving there's AI there's crypto like things are just speeding Have you had to adjust how you strategically invest in companies? Whether it's how quickly you invest or how much time you spend on diligence or um just in general, have you found yourself having to evolve or do you feel, you know, um proud in the fact that you have really been able to stay true to like these are how this is how I do it here? Yeah, that's a great question. So, the process is compressed generally in the seed market. It's gotten more competitive so because of how many VCs there are so many more VCs at the seed stage like than when I was doing it earlier in my career. We used to be able to take our time. We used to be able to do a ton of diligence and um and the companies were typically a little bit further along um ironically like they you know and you had more to look at I guess uh in a lot of ways but um you so I do a lot more customer referencing you know and now things are going pretty quickly and you have to so we end up doing deals a little faster now than we had in years past and I think that's largely driven by competition But I also think some of it's compressed too because it's easier and when I talk about founders having their their together when they are going to engage in the fundraising process people can come to the table with a it's not a there's so much content around about like what should founders do in a fundraising process like when people are really ready to engage like they actually have a lot of the stuff that you want to see and you can see it really quickly and um and that's all been really great. So you can make decisions pretty quickly um in terms of getting the data and doing the diligence. And um I also think that with sales cycles have been for companies have been compressed and the ability to deploy software has shortened where people can start running sometimes in days or hours utilizing tools. Whereas before if someone won a customer it might take like a month for them to get implemented and get going. And um you can now look at so many customers that and you can see a little bit of the life cycle of a customer almost a little quicker now than you used to in the past because you can win customers quicker now. So you can see if they're churning, you can see if they're not using the product anymore. You know, maybe just the one internal champion's using it then no one else wants to use it and you're like, \"Okay, maybe this isn't going to go anywhere. They're going to have a hard time upselling in the future because no one else cares about the product.\" Like you can see some of those things a little earlier now. So how have things changed for us? I think, you know, we're we're making somewhat faster decisions, which in some respects you might think, well, that's maybe not a good thing. You're rushing a judgment. I think we're still checking a lot of the same boxes we've always tried to mentally check around the product and the market opportunity, the competition and the management team, but we're just doing it a little bit more efficiently than we have in the past. And some of it's through the AI tools, too. Like market research used to be really a slog. And you can get access to information now in seconds that um even competitive landscape and some of the stuff you can get insights on pretty early which is great. And then honestly just technologies like zoom just have removed the friction out of like doing meetings with people whether even if it's customer referencing or whatever but like that's also compressed things. has I'm curious do you have like do you have any philosophy or perspective uh postcoid on inerson verse zoom meaning let's say you've got two great founders they both are in a similar market with similar technologies with similar founding team and structure and for the most part they're about as even as they can be in that regard but one of them uh flies in from New York to sit down with you in person and the other one takes it from Chicago in their office or in their on Zoom Is there any weight to you? Have you like um Yeah, I'm curious. Yeah. Not just because they're making that sacrifice for me, but for me that biggest indicator is how are they going to win customers in the future? If they have a big customer on the line, are they going to try to win that account from Zoom? Are they going to get their ass on the plane and go seal the deal? And that to me would be the biggest indicator right there. And honestly, and whether it's TX's, you know, email responsiveness element, like a lot of what I'm looking for when I'm engaging with a founder in that process, it's yes, they're kind of selling me on their company, but so I'm now getting a little bit of a view of what it's like when their customers are being sold to by them and is that a responsive process? Are they are they listening to me? Are they, you know, in terms of like hearing the feedback and really understanding where we're at? um you know are is what they're providing well organized and stuff is it what I'm asking for um that those are that's kind of part of the process like oh yeah do we want to move forward with this person and I I'd mentioned Nick at Ocace he was incredible at that followup he was so organized all the stuff was together he was rapidly responded it's funny like I TX probably on to something I'm going to start using that that email responsiveness I'll let him know he's he's secrets out cat's out of the bag but well even for founders I mean, hey, they should know it matters. They should know how important it is. I think some of it is again like, you know, you're running 100 miles an hour. You've got teammates and your family and you you sometimes lack there are just blind spots. You can be the most empathetic person and not realize until you hear someone say it like, \"Oh that's the thing. Oh man, I need to get on that thing.\" And it's in your it's that's like the one thing that really is in your control, you know? It's uh you can be on top of that. Um and and yeah, that's that's that's really uh I think good to hear you say that because I think that you know uh the younger generation, you know, uh the the young 20 something year olds I think have with especially uh co being part it's like they didn't even go to college in class. And so um I think it's important because a lot of the new up and cominging businesses these they're run by 19year-olds, 20-year-olds, 22 year olds. And so to hear that, you know, if they're going headto head that like that little extra thing, that one and a half hour flight from LA to SF or and well, and it's not just that like making the sacrifice of time and showing like I I I'm committed and I want to try to win this, you know, I care about this. The personal relationship is so important. I mean, it's basically like a marriage when you're taking money from a seed investor. M I mean most marriage I think it's like 50% of the marriages in California don't last more than 5 years or is even 3 years. I forget what the stat is but it it's something sad. Uh but seed investments and we're we're in companies for seven to nine sometimes more years. That's longer than most marriages. Yeah. And if you're only kind of consummating that relationship over Zoom, you're I think you're missing something there because I think there is something with the face to face. Yeah. And the personal chemistry and interaction. And I think you just get more reads on the person too. Um at least from you as the investor. But I think it goes the other way like the honestly it's probably more important for the founder to really understand who are they taking money from. In fact, a negative signal for me. You asked about like red, you know, like red flags and like hell nos. I mean, it's for me it's not a complete like hell no, but if the person that I'm investing in doesn't ask for a reference from me, that's a really bad sign. Like they they need to be taking diligence from me. Like they're engaging in a rel, you know, partnership with me. They should have a sense of what I'm like to work with. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I might be friendly on the Zoom and interact nicely on emails and look at positive attitude, but maybe secretly I'm a jerk. Yeah. Yeah. You know, like I'm not. But like, you know, they should ask. So I I I really want founders to talk to some of the founders like who have you recently invested with you know can I talk to that person 100% like I want they should be asked like all founders should ask that of VCs before I mean you can do it postterm sheet or like when you're in the term sheet phase it's like hey you know I'd like to get some references um because honestly and unfortunately there are a lot of in our industry and um you know for the founders like if you have a choice you know keep you want to keep out of your life. Of course, it sounds obvious, but like yeah, you really do cuz it it can be a huge source of pain. I mean, for one of my companies, we just they just raised a series A and we I'm going to not mention the names of this company, but like part of that A- round was to take out an existing investor that was a huge negative force on the company and a massive energy drain on the founder. It was terrible. And I'm so happy these guys are gone. Um, but man, it was such a negative. And to make matters worse, we had he he did reference checks and got negative feedback about this VC and still move forward. And um and and they were as advertised, in fact, even worse than advertised. And it was terrible. So like he he even did the references and he and he ignored the negative signal and that was a miss. Yeah. So like founders out there like due diligence on your investors prior to taking money from them. Yeah. My dad always says you can't do good business with bad people. And totally that I love it. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. How do you foresee the future or like how do you foresee like the ongoing evolution of venture capital uh in regards to AI in regards to I you know remember being like the guy that was like oh thank god the creative industry is safe from AI you know and then it's like the first thing that comes out is like oh copywriter is gone you know creative strategist like no no problem like chat GBT can do everything and now you're seeing things like, oh, upload models, oh, take the data room and just toss it. It's like there's so much and you can either be on the side that's like, oh, this is going to kill my job or take things away from me or use it as the tool. And I'm just curious like, do you see, you know, I think that's one one of the cool parts about you coming from a startup is that you're you're always like, well, where are we going to be in a year or in two years? And you can kind of like see out a little bit. when you like close your eyes and look out into the world of venture, do you see it changing and evolving rapidly and and how do you kind of see um your role evolving over time? Yeah. So, I guess there's two things there and in the venture industry where it it's becoming a very like bifrocated market where you're you have these mega funds that are they're sucking up 70 80% of all the dollars that go into venture capital are going into these massive massive funds that like the Sequoas or the like Sequoas Andre Exactly. Excel some of these like multi-billion dollar funds and they can't deploy capital in small checks efficiently. They just it does not work. It's too much overhead to manage all of the things or like Yeah. And to source the deals and Yeah. They I mean they would be if they were writing million2 $2 million checks, they'd have to do like five deals a day. Mhm. You know, to deploy the capital over time. It's just it doesn't work that way. And then it's a managing the portfolio is the part that really doesn't scale. Writing the check is kind of easy. But then tracking it and all this stuff, it it becomes a mess. and um that part doesn't work. So, they're kind of moving upstream and and writing the bigger checks, which is good for the growth market. Well, I don't know if it's good for the growth market, but you know, there's plenty of money up there. Mh. And then at the seed market, you're going to have a lot of more firms like us, which I consider ourselves like a boutique venture firm where we're managing, you know, $50 million at a time where we are writing the $1 million checks. But I think the pool it's going to the number of VCs are going to shrink in in the seed space which is not as good for founders that you know I think there are going to be less potential sources of kind of traditional early stage capital because like the a lot of the the big guys have gotten too big or they're just not even really playing in the space with a caveat that like in the Bay Area those deals are still getting done and people but they're like it's a $5 million seed round with like you someone with a PowerPoint like, \"Hey, here's five million bucks.\" Like, I can't write anything smaller than that, but go for it. Let me know how you launch it in my pocket. Exactly. So, like that's what happens up here, but like it doesn't happen so much down here in SoCal and a lot of the other markets. Um, so that that fragmenting of the market is is kind of interesting. It's leaving this big hole in the middle of people that used to play here. Um, so it's ch it's that's tough. I think that's going to create a weird dynamic for founders. But on and on then on the company side, you know, you were talking about all these AI tools and how do people avoid the disruption going forward or how do they benefit from the disruption and benefit from it. I mean, it kind of goes back to my earned insight point and talking about relationships. I mean, relationships really matter. The technology by itself doesn't sell itself. People don't want to use it uh, you know, deeply within their organization without some kind of accountability or interaction with it going forward. long term I think for most vertical markets. So I think you need someone to sell it. You need someone to do the customer support. There's always going to be some support element. Um I think there needs to be that product element where you are constantly making the product better. And yes, you can do analytics and see how people are using the product and what features are being used the most. But like you're going to need someone engaging with that customer like what should we be building next? What's another painoint that you're solving that we haven't addressed yet? There needs to be that relationship element and that is going to be that's always going to matter and it's going to be the big differentiator as these AI tools are pretty commoditized. Yeah. I mean people aren't it's funny like what's really changed for me in the last 20 years is people and one big difference you asked about the diligence. We used to do like source code walkthroughs. We spent a lot of time understanding why the technology is so hard to replicate and build. And we'd ask a lot about patents like what what what's your IP? I don't ask about IP anymore at all really because you're almost just assuming that like it's all commoditized like everyone's doing it and whatever you're doing is going to be ripped off. So like what other moes can you create that are not about the technology and it's usually these relationships or strategic partnerships or something else that gives you some edge that's not the tech because the tech is becoming the commodity now. So like it's so funny like I don't even and we don't yeah we I don't look at source code anymore. We we don't go through that cuz it's it's all going to change and soon everyone's going to kind of have the same tech platform to work from or at least things that are similarish, you know, whether you're using anthropic or if you're on open um um you know, open air catchb these they're all kind of the same. Yeah. Yeah. And then they're changing really quickly too. So it's like the AI like no they are not the same. Exactly. And look, I appreciate they're not, but like for you, most applications are going to be built on top of it, like those differences are pretty nominal. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, yeah, the tech matters less and less, but what really differentiates are those relationships, the ability to have the strategic partnerships. Um, I mean, business model used to be a differentiator, but again, that can be easily more easily replicated when everyone is leveraging the same technology base. Um, so it's like where do you get a cost advantage? Those are hard now. M um so it's it's interesting but in a world that's become increasingly commoditized like it's getting harder to do venture uh or it's getting harder to find something that you feel like is truly unique. Yeah. Like I backed a number of deals where it's like we have these PhDs who are like some of the only handful of people on the planet that know how to do this. Like that doesn't happen anymore. Now kind of everybody knows how to do it or it's it's pretty easy to replicate or um get a boost from the AI. Exactly. Or to quickly catch up. I always wonder like it's got to be tough for you at some level when you have operational experience and not just operational like sold like been through the thing that everyone you're investing is trying to get to this place but you're not actually like sitting in the room building the company and so you only have so much you can do to drive success. How do you define success for yourself? like how what feels like success for you as a VC and what are you oriented towards? I mean that a generic level at least with my investors we're trying to triple everybody's money minimally. So that's like the you know what I you know we're investing money I'm trying to generate a return and I'm trying to generate at least three. If you give me a million bucks I want to give you back three and hopefully a lot more. And some of our prior funds are doing that which is great. Um that's like high level. That's my main benchmark. But from like taking it down another level, you know, how do I define success? I for me it's it's helping companies live up. It sounds generic, but it's like helping companies live up to their fullest potential, whatever that ends up being. So, you know, when you start on day one, you hope that everyone's potential is being the next Google. But you realize over time because of competition, because of market dynamics, like things that happen with the management team, whatever, uh it's not going to be a huge huge home run. But if you can redefine, you know, you have to constantly redefine success along the way for each company and in terms of like what's realistic and within time frames that kind of hopefully for me at least align with what we're doing, which is like a 10-year period. So you know what is success a modified success in this tenure for each one of these companies and for each one of those founders. Um, you know, some VCs, you know, feel like anything less than a 10 times return cash on cash is a disappointment. But, you know, there are some situations where you can feel like some of the deals I'm most proud of are situations where we, you know, maybe got three, five times our money, but like at one point it was going to be zero and and those founders are now worth, you know, tens of millions of dollars. and like they are now off and going doing really great things themselves and kind of paying it forward and now they're angel investors and new things and like that feels like a great success and I take a lot of you know pride and joy out of seeing that happen even though it wasn't one of my best deals. Jeff little philosophical uh I don't even know what what word to use for say but when you hang the gloves up when it's all done no more investing you're fully retired you're you're done done what do you want your legacy to be amongst the founders that you invested in so I've always what I aspire to now is to be the first person that they are calling with good or bad news um as it relates to their company and I want to be that person for them as long as possible and maintaining that relationship over time. And um in fact, my wife gets really upset with me generally because most founders, they work their asses off and they're not doing like these uh you know, emotional phone calls in the middle of the day, you know? So, by the time they're done working, it's by 10:00 at night or 11 and then they're texting me like, \"Hey, do you have time to talk?\" I'm like, \"Okay.\" And I was like, I thought like you're gonna take it's gonna be about midnight. you're just starting to talk with someone outside, you know, someone right now and like but you I want to be that person for that founder because that's when they're needed. And for me, like I I would like to if they will look back, you know, on me is like, you know, Jeff's the person that I always go to, you know, when I needed someone or I, you know, the first time we closed that big deal was the first person I let know. Like that's the relationship that I want as a seed investor. And then to kind of maintain that over time, that's my that's my goal. Jeff, you're the man. This was such a great episode. I love having you here. Thanks for making the trip down and uh yeah, thank you again for joining us today on Demo Day. Appreciate you. It was awesome to be here again, Sean. Thanks so much. Awesome. And everyone watching from home or listening in. I'm Sean Goldbound from Coefficient Labs and this is Demo Day. Talk to you soon, guys. See you on next episode. Peace. [Music]",

    "transcript": "hey guys on today's episode of TCA Crossroads we have one of Orange County's great VC's Jeff bokan with okopy Ventures where we'll be talking about the current funding climate we'll learn more about the firm and just learn more about what they're into and what's hot and what's not and it'll be a lot of fun stay [Music] tuned all right and as always with me Mr David Freeman how are you today I never had it so good so good to see you C likewise it's been it's been a minute David that that we've uh put out a podcast episode together uh what you been up to yeah I've been running around looking at deals I mean we've it seems to be everyone wants to look at deals towards the end of the year and September October get real busy I was up in uh at Pepperdine most fundable companies last week I think last week we looked at about 40 plus companies this week I looked at about 40 companies and you know by this time I have a pretty good perspective on what what is uh what what kind of companies want funding and why they want funding and how we're going to fund them but it was great I mean fantastic couldn't complain so so I'm kind of a numbers guy at least roughly you saw about 80 companies how many of those do you think are going to get funded well a couple of the companies we actually did fund that went through Pepperdine most fundable companies most notably neox which came out as a gold um winner uh but probably out of the 80 um I'm not sure how many TCA will fund probably around two three maybe but a lot of these companies especially the ones that most fundable companies uh will get funded by a variety of companies incl including potentially oopy which leads us to our guest our Our Guest who is our guest today David tell tell me a little bit about who we have on the show but don't tell me too much because we want to hear it from him as well all right well we have Jeff bokan he is with oopy so come on down Jeff all right here comes Jeffy Jeff hey hey hey welcome to the podcast there we go we've conjured you how are you today sir I'm doing great doing really well thanks happy to be speaking with you guys it was fun hanging out with you guys last week too uh but good to good to be on your pod yeah for sure thanks for uh making time for us and I do want to just ask a question um that that our viewers might be wondering how do you pronounce your last name oh yeah boan David David nailed it it was great but I'll even answer to bacon I mean everyone loves bacon right you switch the O and the a bacon kind have to go with Bo I think we all answer to bacon you know somebody just waves some bacon I'm just all right I'm on my way awesome cool well now that we've settled that we can wrap up all right guys thank you have a good day just kidding all right uh so so you are you know okopy Ventures is one of the VC firms that I've known about for 10 15 years they're kind of a staple in Orange County one of the OG SAS investors in Orange County I I pretty sure I pitched Mark about any meeting my last company um why don't you why don't we dive in and tell us a little bit about um f first yourself and then okopy and and kind of the history and what you guys are all about sure um so I've been doing venture capital for a little over 20 years now um and I've done it in a handful of markets uh and then most recently here with okopy for the last six uh over the years so I've been a VC in London England uh Santa Monica for a bit an ARB an Arbor Michigan and then here in Newport Beach uh I've always been doing early stage um you know different investment strategies over those time periods when I was with uh two other firms saffron Hill Ventures and baron G and now okopy but um lately we've been focused on Enterprise SAS uh along the way you know had the chance to back some really great companies in the cyber security space as well um Duo security was kind of one of my biggest wins that I had which kind of pioneered two two Factor authentic ation sold to Cisco for a little over three billion and um I was lucky enough to be the first investor into that and nice uh our firm oopy our one of our big home runs was crowd strike another cyber security company um so we've had some success in cyber but which is kind of fed us into focusing more on Enterprise sasu over the last couple years you're right that as a firm we are one of the ogs mark and Sharon got okopy started in about 2005 and it actually kind of spun out of octane of all things um some of the octane the backers of octane liked what was happening in terms of the work of developing the community here in Orange County but there wasn't really any money to go into the companies that they were trying to nurture so some of the um original octane backers which were some corporations like Western Digital um connectent systems Edwards Life Sciences some of those companies were some of the foundational LPS of okopy originally and uh it was created to you have a pool of capital that could go into companies that were here both in Orange County and Southern California and that's continued to be our f i me the our LP base our investor base has evolved over the years as the corporates kind of come and go and then the strategies evolved but we continue to focus on Southern California as our and for the companies that we're investing into we're investing out of our fund for now and um in the last the last 35 deals that we've done over 90% of them are based here in Southern California kind of Santa Barbara down to San Diego with a good chunk of those being in in Orange County and we typically lead a seed round uh of a company it's usually their First Institutional round that they've raised maybe Beyond friends and family maybe post Angel rounds we work with Angel groups like TCA a lot um kind of then doing the next price or the first price round of a deal we'll write a Circa one million do check into a$2 to three million do seedr that we lead we typically have a board seat with the companies we work with with and are really Hands-On for the first three plus years of the company as they move to their series a and Beyond um and we got it do a lot of enterprise software um we do really we're kind of generalist though we'll do a little bit of everything um we don't love Hardware businesses and we don't do healthare anymore um and just software driven companies is what we're looking at back see I met I met Jeff a while back over uh with a company in San Diego you know and um now that I know that you are In Crowd strike um I have another potential opportunity working together but tell us how you work with the angels yeah so um I mean we love angel groups um I mean it's an important source of deal flow for us um and not only in terms of finding opportunities but working with the angels post investment um because a lot of times Angel back deals you know an angel usually has gotten involved with a company because they have uh some personal Insight industry contacts affinity to that industry some uh where they can add more than just to add more in value than just whatever check they wrote um and we' like having those investors um involved with the companies in the early phases as I mentioned you know we're typically leading a seed round it might be a million dollars of two but like we Syndicate out the rest um so we like to Syndicate those rounds with Angel groups if they aren't already in deals so we'll show some Investments that we're leading to Angel groups and for those that can move pretty quickly we can get those done um and uh so that's one way that we work with them one is just kind of helping identify opportunities and sharing deal flow uh the other is after we've made a decision on making an investment to uh bring in angels where we can um and but a lot of times there are already Angels involved because we kind of come in post that that first check Where Angels have gotten things going and then work with them as closely as we can to help the company live up to their fullest potential makes sense awesome so um just on the Enterprise SAS space right now uh there's obviously a really hot thing happening uh maybe you've heard of it it's AI obviously and it just I've been an Enterprise yeah what is this AI um you know I've been an Enterprise Sofer for a long time now and it just seems like you know Enterprise sas's last last week's flavor if you don't have ai enriching your Enterprise sass software you don't if you don't have an AI story to your SAS platform there's no story right what's your take on that yeah I think that's exactly right uh I'm not I've not seen any pitch uh in the last couple months um that is an enterprice ass deal that does not have an AI component to it if it's either on the internal workflow side the way they're building their product or supporting their product or supporting customers or if it's on the customer facing and the interface side where the customer is able to engage with a chat tool or some kind of increased enhanced search functionality or something on the front end but where the AI is not a part of it um yeah so everybody's doing it to some degree and when I when I think about these two categories is like which one's eating the other right like there's one category and the other but I is AI eating Enterprise SAS or is it always going to be Enterprise SAS that companies are paying for and they're going to have they're all gonna have ai inside of it what's your take on that I think it's I mean interested in your guys thoughts on it as well but I think it's more the latter where I I just feel like there's going to be this need for the Enterprise I think Enterprise sass will AI will be a tool and a function of an a broader Enterprise SAS tool just because with any Enterprise the the the the specifics of the workflow of that industry are just so important and a generic tool isn't going to work appropriately and it's not just the workflow of those Industries but it just could be the specific Tech stack of that industry in terms of the way whether it's an order management system and how things are processed and inventory is cataloged or whatever it may be these things are pretty specific and like the founders that we like to back are founders that that have what I call you know earned Insight where you know they come from this industry they've been in it for a while they were either you know they're in that industry as a customer or Building Product for and supporting product in that industry work working with vendors and other people in the supply chain of that industry and they just understand how the industry works and they have contacts and I think that knowledge to shape the tech and the solution is going to be critical for the Enterprise SAS Solutions I don't think there'll just be a generic AI tool that will work in the way that it needs to work for an industry for it to be effective and for it to be adopted quickly and I think that I think you know it will be an important tool and it's changing how everything works but it it's not going to take it things over by itself so let me ask you we yeah so cost and rais is a really good point AI is really critical you know be it a tool or if I guess maybe there's an AI infrastructure but getting your take on what are the other hot areas that uh that you're investing in and then what's not so hot because things are changing especially in the economic environment yeah uh so we're still really focused on um vertical SAS Solutions and honestly I think AI here helps make some of these um opportunities a little bit more exciting than they would have been previously so there are a lot of industries that have where software is present you know there may be some Erp systems that have been around for a long time but there hasn't been a lot of innovation and there are chances for startups to go into some large established markets with some tools that are architected from a first principles basis where they can really start from scratch and not have these the burdens of Legacy system and really offer some value that the current system can't and do so either at a like a huge cost advantage or with some increased functionality it could be around like embedded payments for example so we love B2B Solutions you a lot of businesses today name your industry a lot of people a lot businesses still pay each other by check you know Nancy and accounts payable cuts a check and then you know Chris and accounts receivable gets it and there's still all this latency and all these industri and there are opportunities to build systems that work that remove a lot of the friction for Industries to have things work more smoothly and then also compress the cash cycles for a lot of these companies where they can access uh money I guess with it just reduce their overall sales cycle and cash conversion cycle where they can kind access that money sooner when that has a huge value to it and then for these startups there's a chance not only to sell soft a software SAS um opportunity but they can make money on the payment side too so we've been looking for embedded payments Solutions as like a hot area I just came just met with somebody in the construction materials is space that has a cool Erp tool with um embedded payments and honestly it's the payments piece that I'm most excited about it's an industry that still has is paying people by check and I think there's opportunities like that in in a number of different verticals so we like embedded payments and just other automated workflow tools um almost touching a little bit on uh some fintech it's got a little fintech flavor there but B2B fintech so I think to say areas that are not hot it's consumer fintech which is kind of played out at this point um you know there was this run of you know whether it's the Neo Banks and a lot of people trying to you know do some things fresh on what about digital digal crypto kind of dead yeah I that was not an area we ever focused on um not that think funding funding down funding's down in those spaces like 98% or some some horrible number like that got it got it so um so you're excited about you're still excited about Enterprise SAS you're excited about Payment Solutions that optimize Legacy Industries there's probably a lot of there's still some of these like Legacy Industries they still have their like Windows 98 servers uh in in the back office and a startup could come in there with some little AI sprinkle some AI sprinkle some cloud and boom you might be able to achieve a billion dollar market cap if it's uh a niche industry but big enough to to get that yeah it's exactly right Cloud I mean and honestly even something as simple as mobile which has obviously been around forever and um but just have and again when you think of the workflow and if you have people that are in the field and being able to do stuff on a mobile device and have that tie into the the system which you know there are some industries that still can't do that um so I think there are opportunities in some large verticals where pulling in an integrated solution uh is still doable and and and I like Industries where there are some incumbents where customers are paying a s you know a software company for something but it's probably a very Antiquated software you know 20 years old you know companies like epicore or whatever that have been around forever that have crushed it in a number of verticals and have massive market share in a lot of IND indries but they kind of they didn't do mobile they're not doing Cloud they're you know they haven't done thinking about AI yeah they're right for disrup startups yeah I mean there's a lot of verticals that are pretty big with that sort of dynamic and I I like those so we're looking those right now let me ask you a question about as you touch on these other hot Industries and the ones that are not so hot what are you seeing in valuations you know today BV last year the year before and where do we see valuations going yeah I see like what I'm seeing is pretty bifurcated um so on the earlier seed side I haven't seen valuations come down as much as I would have expected honestly and I don't know what you guys are seeing but like for companies that are pre-revenue or barely any Revenue they're still looking at seed rounds you know Circa 10 million Prix which I feel is pretty high for companies like that like we would prefer those to see that Clos five yeah yeah and I'm still seeing a lot of that and you know there's some really great companies that look really interesting and you know there tough decisions we have to make about whether we want to we're pretty disciplined on our pricing we rarely pay more than 10 million pre for anything un unless it's you know considerably further along but normally we're going into a sub hund a subm million ARR business and we're typically paying less than 10 pre and um so I haven't seen pricing come down for the uh earlier stage opportunities earlier stage with some traction it may not be much but like they have you know a product's working they maybe have some paying customers but only a couple um and small Revenue where it's hard to apply multiples you know because it's like if they're doing 100K and AR it's like no multiple makes sense uh at that the other part of the bif forade Market where I'm see where I'm seeing it the opposite and you're almost penalized for having been in business for a couple years and actually having customers and having Revenue they're the now that's where I'm seeing pricing lower so if you have one and a half two million of ARR those companies are the pre monies are similar to what the kind of the companies that are hav't proved themselves are you know I'm seeing lower multiples there so which you know for us was a great opportunity um if we're investing in those later companies um but I think if you are an angel investor that went in and took the risk early on a company and it's grown and gotten to 2 million or so in ARR like you're you're probably not getting rewarded as you should have been or you were in years past because the valuation there are a little bit lower and that is because the series a round pricing has really come down and the A's have gotten so much harder so the gap between like that first round of capital and that a round has shrunk you know the A's used to be I don't know some a rounds were getting done at 40 50 million now the a rounds are getting done at 2030 y that's what we're say get that incremental jump you know the valuations for those kind of seed extension seed Plus or a company that maybe just raised a couple million dollar on dollars on safes um maybe at you know higher valuations like they're things are kind of flat for them even if they've made progress just because the smaller that jump to the a is not what it used to be got so it's gotten tough for the um and and you know the ear the earlier invest they're thinking well we can make it all the way to that a round just on this one round alone that's kind of what the what they're getting everyone to buy into it's like yeah you can pay the 10 m 10 million pre because we're gonna go just to the a straight away after two years or whatever and as you guys know because I know you've been around for a long time doing this it's it doesn't it really happens that way usually there's an interance around so so we're finding great opportunities in that like medium range honestly and we're employing a little bit l so we're investing right now into companies that are a little more mature um that that maybe benefited from some Angel money or you know one two million that they raised in safes and then we're coming in at pretty attractive prices and we're not pulling the trigger as much on the companies that are selling more of the sizzle than the stake where they haven't really approved it yet coming in at the 10 million pre and it's still early we're aren't doing as many of those gotcha gotcha let me um you you touched upon a little bit but let me ask um if if you were speaking with an entrepreneur that has a company that is thinking about raising a seed round for mopy what would you like to see from them before they reach out or when they reach out what you talked a little bit about the traction but just give us like 60 seconds of like the top four or five uh qualifications you need to see before you're going to take a deal seriously yeah I mean we generally do like to see a pitch deck or some some details that pull together a little bit of the yeah definitely a pitch deck framing yeah framing the thoughts like what are you doing I mean look some people like don't want to send a pitch deck um so we want to see we want to at least see a pitch deck outline the thoughts the thesis like how's this coming together in terms of traction um with the product attration can come in very like if you have customers great we'd love to know as much about we can about the customers that you do have how you want how how um how you brought them on as customers what that process was like um usually it's some of that will be covered in the pitch deck but if not it can you know be through the email conversation here's our go to market strategy this is how we win customers and um and how and then ultimately the business model how how you what pricing you have and um how people pay you and how you make money I mean we don't require a ton from folks but um you know basically brief email explaining what you want and you know we we I get I'm well I welcome cold emails you know then when they come through just paragraph or to explaining what you do along with a deck and I I read um all of them um you know we don't move forward on on everything or very little do we move forward on terms doing meetings but and I provide feedback to just about everything that comes through unless it's just clearly not a fit well if someone sends me like a med device deal we're not doing those anymore I don't really respond to those but if someone's has you know one they've identified my name two they know that we invest in Southern California companies and three they explain why they think we might be interested like I'm I reply to all those got um so we'll give everything a look that's awesome all right Jeff well that was a great overview of a copy yourself the thesis the market I think we covered a ton of ground here in about 22 minutes uh David any any final thoughts for our uh our audience here well we have a couple of uh opportunities coming up for pitch Fest or getting uh entrepreneurs together with investors I think Long Beach accelerator is coming up pretty soon and then there's one coming up uh the startup Game Changer Summit I think that's a Tai and SoCal Alliance putting that together I believe that's next week and I think this podcast will get out before then hope to see everyone there I'll turn it over you for the last words that wisdom C and thanks really appreciate it always good to see you yeah like absolutely thank you I think I think the wisdom came from Jeff on This episode uh you know not much more to add just uh know that there's a great uh Orange County based VC in in oopy Ventures with Jeff there and Mark aett and uh they've been supporting Orange County companies for a long time now so if you meet some of that criteria that Jeff outlined uh reach out to them he sounds like a really nice guy that will actually reply to your email so yeah a l and um yeah and uh all right guys so thank you for um for sticking around make sure to subscribe make sure you like make sure you share and you guys uh have a great rest of your day take care byebye one see you bye [Music] bye",
