        "full_transcript": "entrepreneurs and investors this episode is courtesy of Torro AI the number one recruiting firm for software development and AI Talent all right Kevin welcome to the show I appreciate you taking some time out to join us thank you thank you for having me absolutely so fund manager at sarak ventures before we get to that though I do want to learn a little bit more about you and talk about kind of your path I know you spent a bunch of time on the investment side but you know to give cont give folks context into who you are in your professional career would love for you to give us some background I'll give the high level first okay and then engineering perspective process order super helpful and understanding what I do now and then from there I went to become a financial advisor first at Northwestern Mutual and then second at Morgan Stanley learned a lot at different each of those locations and then from there I transitioned into the regulatory side I went to work for the Federal Reserve Bank while I was going back to school then I got into Venture and started at a seat stage firm here in Oklahoma City where I am and then worked on the lp side of venture at a venture capital fund of funds before deciding to launch my own Venture a a non-traditional path to venture a ton of folks want to learn how do I get into Venture one way you know folks have taken the founder path had an exit decided to move in and on the fund manager side you were kind of you mentioned being a Federal Reserve correct and then transitioning into Venture so how does that actually I mean I understand it's still Finance of some sort but they're kind of two different worlds yeah I think what I've seen in my Venture Capital careers is that most people have these eclectic backgrounds whether they were a founder or they were an operator or they worked outside of the industry I've met a lot of attorneys who became VCS a lot of psychologists who became VCS people who were like poai most important is are you able to actually invest one of the things that I feel like I've done a really good job of in my career is selecting Investments using a framework of how to think about the opportunity so whatever the medium was the medium just changed so if it was investing in a stock or real estate or whatever it was creating a disciplined approach to how you do that and then following that is the way to success I I think my first the interest of investing in general started 2005 is right after I graduated college right and a week after Schwab but at the time it was Scott Trade okay I just started buying I just started buying stocks of the companies I was using on a daily basis like I bought apple and sandis and CVS just stuff like that and said to myself okay each time I'm up a certain percent on a position I was going to sell that position and take my rewards no matter what was happening so I did that consistently over a couple of years and did pretty well and said to myself man you know what if I can develop this sort of investment strategy for myself and be successful at it maybe I can do that for other people and that's what got me on the path to investing in early stage companies I own investment properties so whatever it is just like deciding on a framework sticking to it and really that sort of way of thinking helps you as an investor and I think helps people to really think about oh if I'm G to get into VC or private Equity or whatever you got to be able to think like that right and so that first role you had as a VC or at the VC firm what did it look like I mean I know it can look various ways depending on where you are was it more hey let me go out and Source deals let me be the one that's fetting the deals let me kind of establish some sort of thematic approach to potential companies called it a venture advisor which is kind of like a associate position and then I was also managing an in-house group of investors that they had put together that would co-invest with us into our deals and that was I was effectively the director of Angel Investments so I was managing that group and helping to Source deals for them but as a venture adviser it was the same thing the Mandate we had as an organization was to invest in Oklahoma based technology companies so that's what we were looking for with within that we invested in biotech companies and then just other technology companies I'm not an expert in life sciences or Healthcare so I a lot of Hands-On work because these companies were very early stage right but you know so much of this stuff in Venture I think in just about business is just self-taught and if you have there's so much information out there now where if you want to learn how to invest there's very little barrier to entry to figure that out the hard part is actually getting the opportunity right but obtaining the information that's just something you control so I had been doing that for years studying the industry trying to figure out how to get into it and at the Federal Reserve part of what I took away from that role was we were we would go into through that process where I started to understand one how the money system worked and two how companies actually leveraged up how they operated and do did all these different things I never thought I would get that type of takeaway from working there but it was like cons it was like Consulting to a certain degree because you really had to understand what was happening in order to assess whether the bank was doing a good job of giving people money which in essence is not Venture it's more debt but it's the same sort of concept of are they validating this company well enough to give them Capital yeah and on the Venture side it's both debt and Equity but usually more Equity right yeah that's interesting because the you're you are the advisor you are the middleman you're trying to get a transaction done when you move over to the buy side VC growth Equity PE the core question is this a good business right and so that leads to an entirely different way of thinking right which is what you reminded me of as your exp explaining your experience at the Federal Reserve you know looking at loan portfolios and saying is this a good business yeah absolutely so I mean I think early on in my career and younger people will ask me what do I need to do to move up in my career or get adventured and I'm like you know one there's no linear path in life in general I can talk more about the personal stuff if you want but I always why am I doing this then I heard this voice like this voice in my head that said you know wherever you are be there and I thought what does that mean the takeaway was it's like whatever you're doing try to add and also extract as much value from it as you possibly can because ultimately you're still working toward your goal but everything you're doing is one additional piece to the puzzle to help you achieve that bigger goal right so when I started thinking about my work in that perspective it's like okay what can you've got a lot of folks who are sitting in you know some sort of role and they may not be happy with the company the culture whatever and so you you make question like why am I here and then you kind of Disconnect but you know focusing on the bigger picture and thinking through all right well you know what value can I pull from this since I'm going to be here anyway any but you can either complain about it or actually embrace it and just dive in if you're a hiring manager and you appreciate the unique skill sets required to build AI Solutions then I would highly suggest you get your hands on our AI Talent salary guide as you know one of the greatest challenges in building AI products is acquiring the right team over 100 plus Pages we dive deep into our Global AI Talent acquisition strategies and with our links are in the description so so getting back to this question of what makes a good business or is this a good business I want to talk about your experience as an LP right sitting on the limited partner side and now you're thinking through how do I make investments into and you can tell me more where those dollars went to whether it be Venture private Equity hedge funds but would just kind of love to learn more about that experience because I think it is a side of the world we don't really necessarily get to dig into too much yeah you know and that was sort of an eyee opening thing for me but again going into that role it was about the Frameworks it was just a different one one level up versus sort of into the weeds I actually felt like it was a and once you make the decision there's absolutely nothing you can do about that decision thereafter and what I mean by that is this when you invest in a company it's likely that company is going to raise additional capital and as a VC your job the value ad is helping them with different things operationally such that if they need to tweak something or modify go to market strategy or add a different team member you can sort of help with that and if they need additional Capital you can say oh well we're not going to reinvest or we are right but when you invest in a venture capital fund it's a totally different type of analysis you want to decision you're committed to fulfill whatever amount you said you were going to invest you got to fulfill that commitment over a usually three to five year period but you're locked in for until that fund terminates so going there for me I understood how funds operated but one of the things I loved and learned and sort of pulled from the experience was how do institutional investors make decisions and how do they analyze fund managers to who are the institutional investors in in the world that are doing this I got to meet a ton of those people and then also being on the front end of all the technology that was developed so for example as a VC you you're investing in a fund they're also investing in a variety of different categories of technology so one of the fun things that I experienced at these annual meetings that I would go to is talking to all these different types of Founders building all these different types of Technologies it's always felt like was at the Forefront of so much technological advancement and you got to see it all it was that that was really fun in fact I miss going to some of those annual meetings to see how they did it and then hearing the perspectives of so many different Venture capitalists like really smart people who were running and leading these firms and you could get inside their minds of like the helped and also just visibility on so many different types of presentation decks and so many different nuances of if you're raising Capital who you should talk to and who you shouldn't talk to it has helped inform what I'm doing now at Sak Ventures but I think it made me a better fund manager because you learn at a very detailed level what it takes to actually operate and grow an Institutional level Venture Capital fund right right and and one thing I would love to get your perspective on is you mentioned who you should actually be talking to as someone who is raising a fund right so someone who has no experience actually going out and raising a fund you may just think whoever can write a check but like the things that you took away or that you could share that would be particularly helpful for folks who aren't as well versed in going out in fundraising if they're raising a fund right okay I'm about to I'm about to drop some gems on right now it's about to get real okay so let's just start with say foundations or endowments all right a foundation or endowment if they're a billion dollars or less they're going to work with an investment consultant like a Cambridge Associates or stepstone and I'm not dropping names because I know people there just giving you an example right well then you say they Define the investment strategy but they rely on their investment consultant to actually Implement that strategy and vet opportunities for them most of the time investment Consultants have full discretion over how they're investing on behalf of their clients sometimes they don't now the challenging part with investment Consultants is they do everything on a platform so you have to get approved to be an approved manager on their platform and then once you're on that approved list as they bring on more clients that are looking for specific types of mandates whether it's early stage or private Equity or always new opportunities that are coming up so that's the one thing and I think many people beat their heads talking to either found foundations and theams that are too small or trying to if they get a meeting with an investment consultant they think that they're in I'm like no you're not and you got to get on the list and that's the hard part now for foundations and endowments that are greater than a billion they might have their own investment team internally and those are better because they don't have to use an investment consultant to make a decision so in those cases you're either going to reach out to the head of research director of they're like a CEO of a company their goal their objective is to direct the strategy of the portfolio not necessarily to make individual Investments even though they can't they still have time to do it so that's Foundation endowments and investment cons Consultants so then you have sort of the next rung below that Pension funds right now as you know dar's Pension funds are huge right they also use investment Consultants but they're often so big if you're raising a small fund like mine it's just not even worth talking to them because their allocation amounts can be so large right most what would you consider small in the world of VC so a pension fund or endowment 100 million is is too small they also have concentration limits as you know meaning that even if they do love your fund they cannot be more than 20% some cases 25% of your total fund size so that's another and then you have family offices which are great the challenge with family offices are is they're very difficult to identify to find who they are because they don't have like oh so and so family office some of them do but for the most part it's like llc's or corporations or it's just a company that the family owns and they just happen to invest on the side but they don't help manage their portfolio that team might advertise and usually if their Investment Portfolio is successful they'll start trying to implement their investment strategy for other families that they know then they become a multif family office and it's the same sort of position they'll hire like a head of research they'll hire a CIO these are the people like the head of research like I I always look for that person because they're the Frontline person to determine whether or not your fund or fits their strategy so those that's who you go after not sometimes if they have principles or Associates maybe but that's usually not the case so that's endowments your strategy so if people are fundraising in this sort of manner I always think about it from that perspective like concentric circles you have your high netw Works family offices endowments and Foundations and then at the end is the Pension funds that really big ones when I at my last role at the fund of funds we could invest across the Spectrum we were typically on that outer shell of the concentric Circle because we were large enough to work with pensions endowments and Foundations and then the high net wors were too small even if they wanted to invest but the one caveat with high net worths and I love High net worth I have several in my fund is that usually when you're going to see the performance start to show in that third fund interesting but the high wor they'll say oh you're raising Capital again it's been three years and I'm not seeing any returns then they're like I'm not going to invest anymore so then you have this hole in your fund rise that you have to fill when certainly you're glad they invested the first time but to have to replace investors it just makes it harder over time but you got to do what you gotta are there things that someone who's raising a first fund should consider compared to someone who may be on that second or third fund certainly that you know the good thing about fundrais Target you can either a I'd like to do something Charles Hudson suggested he creates this pyramid and at the base of the pyramid that's sort of like your bread and butter maybe smaller investors and that middle part and top part of the pyramid are your larger investors so when you segment that out you can sort of look at your network and look at how you're going to reach that end goal and start sort of blocking this off so when people ask you what's your minimum you say you can segment it well for individual investors it's this amount for family offices and others it's this amount and for larger investors it's this amount and when you recommend and one other thing that I wanted to ask before we move on to sharak V you know thoughts on if you're raising your first fund thoughts on Fun Size right because you got you know folks who may want to come out and say hey let me raise a $200 million fund and we're going to vest like you know XYZ anything things that you have learned being on the lp side now GP around kind of first fun how folks should think about size as it relates to kind of probability of actually closing so there's two parts of this one if you have a track record and you know what you're doing and the Market's in your favor whatever you have a good probability of closing however if you for example at Sak we're investing in seed stage companies targeting a $30 million fundraise okay well the average seed Stage Company is Raising say $3 million kind of what we averaged but it's not that's the average and the valuations are X so if we're looking for a certain ownership and certain fund or fund raise amount then with a $30 million fund we can fill out a good number of portfolios to take advantage of the power law in what I mean by the power law as you know Darius is you want to have enough companies in the portfolio such that a these connections and you're trying to invest in later stage companies maybe a 200 or $500 million first fund size makes sense because those initial checks that you're writing are 30 or $40 million MH I would think about it more systematically like that or if you're looking at REI companies and you're just trying to get started maybe your fund size is sub $10 million the fund size is not the issue is have you carefully thought about your strategy such that your fund size makes sense yeah I think what I've seen is the ambition to raise a huge fund off the top part of it because hey you want to get management fees to be able to you know hire folks to actually help out and then there are other reasons as well but there's also go for the Home Run uh right away you could build up to that yeah you know the fund size too as a GP most GP commit 1% to their fund so for that first fund when your management company has effectively if unless you just have money you have to figure out how you're going to pay that 1% for each investment that you make now there are ways that you can do that by GP notes and all those different things and should I explain what GP notes are do yeah yeah yeah that would be helpful I don't think most folks would would know about that so most people if they're raising say a $300 million fund don't have 1% of that but as the fund starts to make distributions back to LPS which technically as a GP you are an LP in the fund those distributions go toward paying down the note that you owe so you're effectively just sort of borrowing from the fund but relinquishing your distributions until that note is paid back and that's how people afford to do it because otherwise it's a he it's a big ass yeah absolutely okay great so I want to transition here and talk more about Sak Ventures lost Sak Ventures I think you just mentioned $30 million Target how do you think about we talked earlier about defining criteria for the types of companies that with what me and my team can actually deliver so I love Financial technology companies financial services companies because I worked in that sector for such a long time when we're talking about the nuances of how people navigate Building Solutions within that area I can actually add value there's so much stuff that occurs on a regulatory side on the goto Market side just customer behaviors I get that so that's one of the sectors we look at then I have another person who worked for large Enterprise companies he does a lot in that space and then someone else on the team is really good with B Toc companies so we it's not my specialty so I tend to not look at those types of companies or and you know we have a list of companies we won't do so that's the first thing the other thing that we look at is just general screening criteria of must have a finished product got to have cons consecutive months of growth in your Revenue we're currently primarily focusing on us-based companies even though we can invest internationally for right now we're focusing on the US we want to see a unified team ideally a diversely Le team like a minority or women L team that's not a requirement but it's something that we prefer so those are sort of a few of the initial the potential to continually grow into an expanding space business model longevity effectively does this team and the product have the ability to evolve as the market evolves one of the things I don't like are Point solution feature type companies where they're solving for a feature but not necessarily building the pic and shovels that a mult a multitude of companies are going to use such that they limit their growth see a ton of those types of companies and then the last one is I think I may have already talked about it but just product Market fit which are some of the standard things so that's sort of our sort of strategy at Sak Ventures and how that but we provide a lot of Hands-On support in that area and to supplement what we do as a team we built this we call it our Guild it's a network of experts who help some companies with specific problems as they grow and I think that's the value that VCS bring it's not just the capital right and so can you talk a little bit more about the kind of the expert side because I can imagine folks you know whether it's a firsttime founder or they've had exits already right they may want to tap into some level of consultant who can help so functional experts in you said go to market these different business functions that a company has but we should have access to the experts so for example just this morning before this call I was on the phone with a friend of mine who works at a tech company and I was talking to him about data security and data breach is and how Tech Founders should be thinking about that so I was talking to him about the internal mechanics of why this is such a big concern for companies and who are the service providers that help to solve these issues and he's one of the members of this Guild group and I was talking to a fintech company yesterday asking them about this specific problem that I was researching and he validated that yes because you're not going to know everything I mean that that would be impossible unless say you're focusing on one specific thing 100% of the time but most of the time Founders have a variet of different challenges that they're facing all the time yeah uh I want to get your perspective on the market as a whole so you know 2021 was a great year for folks who are raising but really quickly as we moved into 2022 kind of the funding Market dried up you know do you have any 2023 was rough and I imagine if you're any type of founder outside of maybe artificial intelligence right still uh a little bit Rocky here but want to get your thoughts on you into 2025 I hate to say that because everyone thought it was going to be like oh 2024 is going to be a great year yeah and it's still like I don't know but just looking at Trends in the data we had like the lowest fundraising for VC in general the lowest number of IPOs in general across like the last five or six seven years and the downstream effect is when institutional investors aren't receiving distributions they're not in most cases allocating to new managers and they're barely able to reup to existing fund managers so then what does that do that figure out how do I get Capital to goow my business in the latest pitchbook report from q1 there were 55 companies raising money right now the capital to supply the capital to demand ratio was like one to two meaning that for every dollar that is out there there were like two or three people asking for it and they had a little note in there saying something to the effect of are there too many Founders in the market right now like maybe there are I don't know but everyone's sort of feeling the pullback of what's Happening Upstream in that when these larger pools of capital this era where we're coming out of this zerp era zero interest rate policy where Capital was just flowing freely and now that's not happening anymore IPOs aren't as frequent as they were anymore but couple that with what was already happening in that companies that maybe should IPO are staying private so much longer so there's all this like conflation of all these different things happening so I get it you know it's tough for fundraising it's tough for managers like me who are like starting out in in the market yeah but I understand it's just a cycle and once that cycle ends it'll be better I'm not saying it's going to be great but it'll be better and it'll be different what we're going to spend the rest of the time harvesting but you know you hit this moment where it's like okay well let's focus on our existing companies versus new Investments right is there pressure for GPS to deploy so that there isn't sold much dry powder I'm curious what the thoughts are there related to kind of dry powder but we also need to we also need to make you know the right bets there were I think there's about over $300 billion dollar of dry powder just sitting on the sidelines now going layer deeper the majority of that capital is resting with mega funds 500 the most it's not there I do think that this time that we're experiencing is forcing VC's back to fundamentals yeah of not investing in HP not investing quickly and not investing just because they have money to invest and more so taking their time encouraging portfolio companies to reduce their burn Etc and then also getting back to the philosophy our job is to return Capital to our investors within a 10-year time frame and maybe that goes to 12 years because of our extensions that we can put onto the fund you see the growth of the they won't go public so that's become uh a valuable exit strategy for some of these larger funds to provide liquidity to their investors but people thinking and Mark suster was just talking about this yesterday how IPOs shouldn't be relied upon for the liquidity that you need it's private Equity it's these secondary funds and VCS need to start thinking about this as a strategy to say look it's good to maybe you can get a five or 10x return on a company if you sell to a secondary or a private Equity maybe not that much maybe 3 to 5x but if you do that within a seven eight or nine year time frame that's better than waiting on like a 20x return the next 15 they should have been doing this already so it's kind of frustrating hear that oh this is a return like no this is what VC VC should be doing yeah which is interesting I know in my PE days we would specifically avoid we would call them kind of VC deals where the valuation was so high that as a PE firm probably not going to make the acquisition just because what we would have to pay is just Way Beyond any multiple that as a PE firm right but we're actually going to pay and so the VC because of how they structured the their initial investment now has tasked to rely on the IPO because maybe they were investing in hype right versus you really did really well over the last 10 years because I don't think they ever really focused just on valuations and they to to maybe to the to their credit or to make things I would say easier they have a little bit more to evaluate whenever they're making an investment and they make fewer Investments so yeah I don't know if it's fair to compare the to but they're very similar yeah interesting so so I know we we're coming up on time here I do want to leave a bit of time you know we kind of crossed the cross the q1 Mark we're in Q2 now as of the recording but anything interesting coming up that you would like to announce for Sak Ventures whether that be you know something that LPS would experienced investor this is my first fund the first year of building an organization is the hardest especially in one of the toughest years in the industry arguably the toughest but but most of that building is done so we have hired a team we've made Investments our infrastructure we've had a first close we brought in a really important anchor investor so when it comes to like drisking a firm like ours that work has been done and now we're sort of hitting our full stride with settling into our investment strategy expanding the book all those different things so if investors are interested in talking to and we respond to every single one of them it's either a pass it's a company we want to watch or it's a company we want to meet with and we think it's just our job to serve people and give them the courtesy of a response instead of them feeling like things get put into a black hole and maybe the last thing I'll say is if you're going to do something do it big and do it with purpose and that was the biggest reason why I wanted to start SCT Ventures as a minority investor especially in VC which I consider probably the least diverse industry that's out there we are an Open Door meaning that we've had doors shut on us primarily because of just where we give you the opportunity to make your case and I feel like that's important purpose that I've been called to with this organization and despite how challenging it is that motivates me every day to keep going yeah that that's awesome I love when when GPS can actually get in and talk about the firm because it it makes it makes Venture Capital more personal right Founders get to really understand that look you know kind of you guys are running the the same race in a lot of ways so uh but awesome Kevin I appreciate you taking some time out to share as much as you have with us and definitely you know best luck and we're going to make sure we stay in touch keep up with your progress perfect thank you"

host of zaka presents my journey we're creating this vulnerable and positive platform you can get inspired and motivated from different leaders from our community today our guest is Kevin Moore who is the founder and managing partner of Sorak Ventures Kevin welcome to the show thank you for having me ah the pleasure is all ours Kevin I'm very excited to have you on um you are our first guest from The VC World was born in Tulsa Oklahoma and I'm a Jamaican Heritage my father actually met my mother in Jamaica when he was there for something I think he was there on some church related matters and they fell in love and then they wrote each other for a year letters not text not Twitter nothing like that handwritten matters back and forth from the states to Jamaica and ultimately they got married and she came to United States and that's I grew up in a Jamaican household oh great great food oh that is right that culture the Jamaican coach I'm also Jamaican as well and saying other Islands got some good food but I think Jamaica holds it down I think that was probably the channel most challenging part my wife is from America and I've always said to her man you could ever learn to cook Jamaican food that would just be like hey man my dream come true don't worry they got they got some they got some recipe books out there somewhere here you go right well you guys start going to Barnes and Nobles and find it right uh what we're like go on what are you gonna say I was gonna say not the same but oh true that is true that is true and this brings me to the next question right now I want to know like what were some of the the lessons that you learned as in your childhood that kind of helped you wouldn't say that they're all false but I never really saw that it was more so we were always busy working on something and while you had your full-time job there was always some sort of side hustle that everyone in the family always had especially my uncles uh my Uncle Bobby Robert Frazier I mean he worked for atmt by day kind of installing uh at the time mobile phones into cars but he was always working on something else whether it was working on cars or installing some electrical equipment somewhere that was just what we sort of grew up around so everyone always hustling and doing things even my that church he was also a truck driver worked for a trucking company and they used to ship goods back and forth between Jamaica and Cuba and they would take ferry over there and he would drive and I didn't learn this until later but he was also fluent in Spanish which I speak Spanish now so I never knew that he had that sort of background but growing up it was just a culture of hard work and my mom always used to tell me it's better to try and fail than to not try at all and that's sort of my mentality but I go through life that's very big right there you know sometimes people get a little nervous and worried and like I don't know if I want to try it but you never know you transition steps that if I had not listened to that advice I wouldn't be where I'm at today yeah parents always knew what was best for us you know they would say they were speaking metaphors you know the Caribbean culture and you'd be standing there like what you said it don't make no sense but you know 10 years later you're like oh you know what that made perfect sense that made perfect sense now I'm I I know growing up as a child you know there are always those uh challenges in uh someone's life right what would like some of the few challenges that you had to deal with as in your childhood that kind of shape you professionally in your journey I used to be really ashamed to talk about some of the losing a job we ended up losing our house then we were homeless for a little bit living in sort of a back House of a friend of his and uh it was tough but it was a tough time I think our entire the entirety of my fourth and almost half of my fifth grade spent living in that in those conditions and you know I always try to sell myself everybody at some point they're you know if they have went through hard times that went through something difficult but I remember those days vividly from you know they're not being a bathroom there not being Heating and Air in that facility and feeling know especially as I've worked in venture capital and there's a Frida Kapoor capor at k-por Capital in San Francisco probably at a conference that she was talking about this sort of subjective metric that she uses to gauge uh with some entrepreneurs he called it the distance traveled metric and she said that you know where people are in life is not a function of sort of the things that they 've accomplished on their own it's a function of you know a lot of things that they've had to overcome and she said that I would rather work with someone who's overcome a tremendous amount of obstacles to get where they are versus someone who's at the same comparison to other people who do what I do I think mine is pretty high but again I don't know everyone else's story all I know is mine well you definitely did come up on top you know and then you said fourth and fifth grade out that's pretty young you know to be yeah yeah I was probably how are you in the fifth grade 10 or 12. I was going to say yeah and you know obviously this is when you want to socialize and hang out with your friends like you said you tell them like you can't come over you know and then to find that finding other ways of still being active in school but knowing that when you go home those those issues will the thing is in hindsight it's easy to say that but when you're going through it you know I think when kids are going through situations like that you kind of just sort of you know it's not great but at the same time you don't know of any other option I mean you might see your friends or people around you living a certain way but you kind of learn to just sort of deal with what you have I mean kids I think are the most resilient people out there quite frankly more resilient than some adults and I think going through those periods in my life was more like and people running through the neighborhood with weapons and shootings and just all those different things I mean you I wouldn't say you get used to it but you certainly get to a point to where you can just I wouldn't say becomes a regular part of the day but you do kind of get used to it and you still know it's not good you just don't like it but what else can I do it's not like I could lead the situation I think for a Time in my the way that my brother who roughly 12 or 13 months older than I am he responded to the divorce and to the situation differently than I did I think I had the benefit of being the younger sibling who something different I want to do the opposite of that so it's kind of like a reverse role model effect where I've never for a large part of my life I was never motivated by people who were successful I was always motivated by not wanting to mess up and see and repeat the mistakes that everyone else around me was making that's not really a good way that's not really a good way to to live your life I will say that I've moved away from that but for a time I was always motivated by failure than success at a young age I mean again you you that that story alone and an engineer I was very into art and drawing and I thought I could translate that into you know building things I was a curiosity led me to think man with all this with all this curiosity maybe I should be an engineer because I always wanted to know how things worked and that's what I did I originally wanted to be an architect and when I got into college I realized that wasn't the path that I should take but engineering was sort of that path I actually didn't get interested in finance until my very last year in college just from again curious about numbers like man you should work in finance you know basically he said that to me and I think that popped my interest but what that led to and sort of what I realized later this is when we actually left the state of Oklahoma I was living in Chicago I'm really really dove into finance and started thinking how much of a difference it was making in my life just from saving and investing and I started doing a lot of that stuff on my own and then I thought man I'm doing fairly well for myself perhaps I could do that for other people and that's what sort of that was the transition point I see I see I see now what was it like after graduating from Oklahoma State like I know you went back and you went back for the limits of the the chains were were off and I could do whatever I wanted to do and within a week of graduating I had left you know part of part of leaving where I grew up was intentional but also a way of I wouldn't call it a state but just a chance to sort of start over right and build my life the way I wanted it and uh I did that you know we we left school I mean I was living in Chicago less than a week after graduating you know we had very few knew who I was because I purposefully left a lot of that part of my identity behind me and I just didn't want to embrace I didn't want to embrace it and I still like even this interview I still feel odd talking about it because it's like when I always think about the future and try to stay positive and and like working hard to always try to work hard in some cases just distract myself from some of those things that I was telling you earlier but for a long time you know you know being being in Chicago and being out of school was like this defining point of like all right I think the Imposter syndrome is very real and when you come from like in my background and you know where you're like the first person to go to college and and I imagine that a lot of people listening to this feel the same way it's like you're probably the first person to go to college you're the first person to do a lot of things and you're entering into environments where the majority of people have an experience what you've experienced so I think wrestling through their emotional and psychological components of that that is like very real and I think that you guys are really on to something with these continue to strive towards success despite all those things it's now motivation but it is it wasn't it was an issue for a while and what helps you get through that and when now you're talking about these struggles you're talking about the you know a lot of these transitions you know from school to the the divorce to you know college you know all these things are happening but you're as you could see through your story visit this uh is Beauty in the story like every time you kept moving forward something new came into you right you came into a new a new place to live you getting married you're graduating things kept on coming but how what kept you motivated to keep moving find my purpose in in God and finding like strength in that sort of one thing that never changes and I felt like if I got through all that and God tells me where I'm at for a reason and I've always sort of anchored myself on that regardless of what was happening around me so I I can't I don't want to take credit for things that I had no control over I think there's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad but most people like don't choose the bad things that happen to them and to a certain extent yeah when something really good happens to them people want to take they want to claim they take credit for it when really it could have just been a blessing and I something that as a VC I talk about too the reason why like we build portfolios of companies is because we don't know which one of those companies will be successful we know that the probability is that a few of them will but we don't know which ones at the beginning and it sometimes bothers me when I see my some people in the industry take like all this credit for these companies that succeed it's like they knew the whole time I'm like you don't know so I think I think about my life the same way it's like my the only thing I can control is my faith has never went up or down it's always been the same because I don't look at the outcome of how things turn out to determine how faithful I'm going to be for something does that make sense you better you better you better drop a gem right now that was very deep and I appreciate you sharing that you know because I know a lot of times when people are going through stuff it's very hard to kind of get out of it but this as you said you got to believe in eye and power you know whatever it is you know beside yourself to kind of get you there but I like how you said you just kept it neutral no matter what blessing came you where what struggle came your way you just you kept it even along the way and you mentioned the key word and then you said the capitalists invest in typically early stage high growth companies usually in the technology sector because those are companies that are easy to scale meaning that you can put a lot a little bit of money into a company that doesn't require like a tons of hard assets or tremendous amount of sort of dollars in order to create like an exponential outcome so Venture capitalists is an industry where they are usually the people who are expecting the most risk and accepting a high the Investments that didn't succeed prior I think that among asset classes you have your Venture Capital which is like the risky dollars then you have private equity which are your more or dollars that go to more mature companies that are still private and then you have your public companies that you can just invest in in the stock market or in your mutual fund or whatever but you know BC used to be like a cottage industry like really small and now it's evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry across the world I I I agree with you on that uh it's definitely growing and it's getting a lot more exposure and I'm glad you kind like navigate on the landscape and finding those individuals and those Partnerships meaningful Partnerships if anything I think that navigating the landscape comes with understanding how it works and how it's structured uh mirror layers to it right there think about like a Target like a bullseye or the target symbol like that inner core of the circle is say you and then with or let me say differently let's say that's just the the startup financing center of the universe when you move out to each concentric next circle out are organized Angel investment groups and Angel Investors are typically higher Network people who are investing their own money into startup companies and what they will do is they'll organize groups of 25 50 people who meet on a regular basis to look at deals they're not professional investors but they have more money to invest than your family and friends and then one step above that is where you start to enter into Venture Capital where you have your pre-seed seed et cetera and then so on a PE and public markets but I talk about that because when you think about navigating the sort of going to go talk to a venture capital you're probably going to want to get connected to an angel group or your family and friends so for my industry when I'm thinking about finding different investment opportunities or looking for co-investors or even looking for Founders depending on the stage that I'm looking at I'll know which one of those sort of rings within the circle to start either marketing to or attending events or reaching out to people on LinkedIn and in my network and start sort of building those relationships because now that I've been in the bit in the VC space for almost 10 years I have a number of people that I know in now was that something I came about when you were um a financial advisor at Morgan Stanley and I know you were at Northwestern Mutual as well did those days yeah those are these influence you well yeah so I just just to clear things up for the audience so after I got my degree in engineering I worked that job for two years and then I went to work in finance as a financial advisor wanting to help people with their Investments Etc if I did that for four years at Northwestern Mutual and then two years at Morgan Stanley and that's when I went back to school to get my mbas and during that time I went I was working at the Federal Reserve Bank as a bank examiner funds manager before starting um it's Iraq Ventures so having that sort of color across the financial industry you know sort of informed me with how to sort of navigate through things for sure but it wasn't just one place it was really a culmination of all those different areas now the transition from engineering to finance is like a unique Journey overall right you know if you're an engineer and you said you want to look into at one point looking into being an architect and then you switch over in the finance world and you know into investment you know how did you leverage like your civil engineering degree uh to then move that was something he enjoyed doing and I would be like bro it's over like it's over like leave that alone he's like no you got this week I like solving these things well I tell you that is a it's a blessing and a curse and I think that you can do that to an extent and I I actually had to learn how to not do that and people always thought man it's going to be hard for you to transition from thinking like that but that wasn't the part of in being an engine or Diet Grace and I feel like I took over but in addition to solving problems Engineers are also really good at like process mapping and when I think about the application of what I learned as an engineer it's not so much yes the it's a business for example one of the things we talk about is finding like positive unit economics in a business and basically what that means is if you can figure out a way to repeatedly make money then how do you build a process to make sure that it happens every single time and when I think about the application of that the companies that's one thing I'm always thinking about like what's your process for doing X Y or Z so that sort of framework for solving problems comes from understanding the process and I always talk about this like with my daughter who she she doesn't love math and I always tell her like man to me Matt was the most straightforward subject in school because there was very there's no argument there's no back and forth there's no gray area so math is definitely that's why he was like I forgot it I think he did he did something in finance and Lisa that's why he moved in that direction because he said he couldn't do the back and forth stuff yeah I love math for that reason and I will tell you though sometimes in this the market if you see one plus one doesn't always equal two but I mean that from the standpoint of like sometimes things that don't make sense like how in the world are certain companies super successful the market changes and then sometimes every time in the world that some other companies fail he was like that's the sometimes and that's I wouldn't say that that's the norm but for the most part that's what I've the ability to sit down and think about how does this work how can I get to a solution and I know in the VC world and in other places in Corporate America this is something that we always talk about and and try to just obviously want to hear your opinion on it is the lack of diversity right and I want to kind of hear your opinion on the speaking a little bit more on the lack of diversity in the VC world and like with the lack of like minority Founders getting in you know investment opportunities you know if you could talk a little bit more about that BC industry in my opinion is probably the least diverse industry of Industries 1940s and at that time obviously the United States was very segregated very white male dominated and whenever companies within that industry early on were successful there's people within those networks were the ones who benefited from those rewards and then that just perpetuated itself and the hard part about venture capital and the reason why like Venture Capital firms have so much difficulty scaling themselves is because so much of what they do is Network driven in that they need to hire someone they're going to call one of their friends if they're looking to invest in a company they very Network driven and very and I mean it's not just by ethnicity I'm talking about by geography even by the types of companies and Founders that they're looking at and I actually wrote a white paper internment I haven't actually published this yet uh about how technology has made it so much easier for people to actually start a company especially with like AWS and the cost of server space going way down no code low code technology making it so much easier for people to come up with an idea and build that well that's led to over the last 10 or 15 years and a class of founder are women and people of color building amazing companies so for me it's like when you think about like less than one percent of venture capital goes to like black Founders and less than three percent goes to women and people of color including black in general and you're like okay well in 2022 there was close to 250 billion dollars invested into uh and to buy VCS and only three percent of that's going to those Founders like that's a problem not only is that a problem but a person's an enormous opportunity for firms like mine your ethnicity or your your genderness I want to talk to you okay let's get it let's get it if it makes sense it makes sense you know I think it makes sense it makes sense and I think for a long time these boundaries have not have a seat at the table and quite frankly like I was saying earlier like I said I'm an opera I wouldn't say I'm an opportunist but I do think that I would rather work with someone who kind of like me where they've had to overcome so many obstacles just to have a seat at the table I'll take that founder all day because I know that they're going to work their butts off and they're not going to be dismayed when they encounter challenges and problems and they're just going to keep going and keep fighting because they've had to do money on the line too you know if you got to that place in time where someone's willing to invest in your company Hey look it's time to put up some more if you thought you was working back then you know start working even more right right I give I give it to you and and I give it to your firm as well too for just you know giving an opportunity to people that probably would never have that opportunity you know to sit at that table and and share like hey look this is my company this is what I'm looking to do and you guys have the ability to say yay you know it's crazy though you know there's been like a surge of funds sort of trying to faculty's problem when it comes to like money going to diverse Founders and people say hi to you Source deals and how are you getting access to the opportunities and I wish the better question would be man given that you have a wide aperture for accepting what was once a completely closed off group of Founders how are you even handling the amount of deal flow that you're getting to me that would be a good question come on yeah there's like so many like of these hungry entrepreneurs and passionate entrepreneurs I've never had the chance to talk to a VC that I'm not kidding you the deal flow is very robust but for the firms that sort of dominate the fundraising environment not how are you getting vehicle and with that being said like you're you're with your cultural background the things that you've gone through in your life schooling and as well too right you're you have access to a lot of like information that potentially could help in a potential investment like could you tell us a little bit more about like how you how your cultural background could provide you with like distinct you know Insight that potentially an investor and uh would kind of overlook at some point I mean a really good example is into a company that I that I was referred to called solo funds and I individual lenders who had extra cash and individual borrowers who needed cash could borrow borrow and lend money to each other in small dollar increments and these two guys built this company based upon the market environment that they grew up in and growing up they said that you know people would typically have to go to get a payday loan loan or they were getting turned down for uh loans from the bank and Banks typically don't like to lend in this area because it's historically not been profitable but when they were talking about those types of people who need two hundred dollars to get their really strong example of when you have in a broader and more diverse base of investors that can understand some of the challenges that certain entrepreneurs are solving for based upon markets that would have been historically been underserved then you can start to understand how they're coming up with Creative Solutions to build products to serve those customers that were previously underserved and that company has absolutely crushed it and they had told me that when they were first starting to approach Venture capitalists that it took a long time for them to educate path of an immigrant like how do they think about navigating things in this country or what's it like to come from an underserved market and is there opportunity there I'm going to listen to that story because I get it and I'm glad you are taking an opportunity to sit with somebody in here because even if it doesn't work out I know that the conversation that you're sharing with them is also going to give them some insight to kind of walk away and say you know what uh it didn't work out but Kevin definitely put me in the right direction gave me some some valuable tips to some pointers that could help me out for the next time do you allow people to come back oh for sure yeah I never looked at I mean my mentality is how do I add value every single time and I have to write the biggest value I can world of VC is like that not every single company is going to raise the capital that they need and it's just a matter of how I use this platform to be a resource in whatever way I can sometimes it's Financial sometimes it's not now if you're in your background you have a a large background in um Finance investment landscape like how do you stay adaptable I mean Forward Thinking especially like considering like you know technology and like all these market trends you have to I think the most people in this business um now I don't think anybody knows 100 what's what technology is going to be the one that sort of takes out but I think you know before I got into this industry I never really thought about like what's coming next or what how can technology be applied to certain industries or some of these new newer Industries like the Creator economy and what's stuff that's happening with AI and space exploration and future of work and all those different things like most people are like not thinking about that and quite frankly and even with all the stuff that was happening with like blockchain and web 3 and all this thing you go in when you walk into a room and flip on the light switch you're not thinking it's like oh I wonder how that works and how do I get tired of them you just want to know that the light switch the light turned on that's that right come on now come on that's it but people who that's the engineering you right there right you want to know go ahead and I was gonna say that you want to know how it turns on you're like all right where's this connected to right you're probably that person that did it that's sitting there at a dinner table everyone's having a good conversation you're staring at everything like yep that right there is connected to that and that could that know looking at things like an investment opportunity so when I think about new technology I know that I need to stay aware of like all these different things that are happening because there are they are the things that make people's lives hopefully better but I think the average person is just and again I'm not saying that because VCS or even anyone who has interest think about the stuff that they're better I just feel like it's my job to always be in the know about what's happening what technology is there for I stay abreast of that and with your career path that you've we're talking about you know it wasn't until I started working at my last firm where I started at my last form we had the opportunity to invest both in Venture Capital firms and also into investment by co-investments into direct companies with some of those VC firms and it really wasn't until I was there that I started to see this enormous opportunity of targeting Founders that traditionally were not getting venture capital because I was spending a lot of time on the road mainly in San Francisco like um that was really there was a turning point like prior to writing pandemic where I said it's like man there's a there's a big hole in the market for dollars going to be more diverse people and and just geographically so I thought you know going back to when I was an engineer in Chicago I remember sitting at my desk this was in 2000 and fixed and I wrote myself an email and it was an email of all these things I wanted to do by the time I turned certain ages and one of them will start my own Venture Capital firm to make that happen and I knew that it would happen at some point but the moment in time where I wrote it down I knew I wasn't ready for that to happen so all the places I've worked I knew that there was something I could take away from there in order to ultimately spin out and do something on my own but it really wasn't until I saw what was happening in the Venture Capital industry in more detail that I became like extremely motivated to think okay I've accumulated all this knowledge I've built up this network I understand what it takes to run and operate a fund I think in general people have to get to a point to where they just decide to do something or they're just never going to do it at all but for me it was like feeling like I was ready before I could actually make it happen and uh I thought that this would have happened like seven or eight years ago me doing what I'm doing now but I think it happened at the right time it's unfortunate that it's happening in like a really tough Market where fundraising is like really hard but yeah it's it still drinks people ain't showing up right if it ain't a drink involved or something some good alcohol they're not gonna they're not they're not pulling up people have if they have you know when they have a diverse background is just seeing things differently you know that's a huge Advantage especially now in this market where differentiation is I think something that our culture or the U.S culture is really starting to embrace and um when you think about the most successful Tech founders in the United States ever I think it was like 45 or 50 percent of them were immigrants to this country it's like that's not an accident I think appreciate you just opening up and expressing like those hardships in your life because those hardships obviously shapes you to the man that you are today and um it's helped you in your career um through your Journey Through Your Story one thing that I I see which runs parallel to a lot of things you were saying is is that like how your mother said like just not giving up like it's better to try than to just not try at all I think that everything that came your way you tried and not only did you try you actually were very successful at doing it and um I just appreciate you for just just giving those words of advice to our listeners and uh I just want to leave it off if this is this if there's any words that you could share with you know aspiring immigrant entrepreneurs who are looking to like start their Journey or maybe even start these are all from people who personally had a big impact on me the first one I would say is however my mom said it's better it's better to try and fail and to not try at all that's the first one and I remember as a kid my dad would always tell us do the best with what you have and basically it's a keep an attitude of contentment and do the best with whatever situation you're with and then the last one is an advice of action I remember a person telling me he was like when you don't know what to do do what you know and that has always been something that has motivated me to take action and not sort of rest of my Laurels or think that I need to know everything before I do making us really think of it listeners get your pens out get your pads out because heaven is dropping some gems on the show today uh Kevin again thank you thank you so much for your time and just for your knowledge um and just for just like again you should your your Vibe like it's amazing um Story Journey and I love uh connecting with you today now I appreciate the time and uh love to do it yes and I want to let the listeners know if you want to hear more stories like Kevin check us out on sakaconnect.com or follow our feed Saka wherever you listen to your podcast"

        "full_transcript": "Ventures how are you doing Kevin I am fantastic how are you I'm good thank you so much for coming on I'm so happy that Daryl introduced us and connected us um yes Kevin please tell us about uh about yourself and about sarak and what your focus is high level I've been in finance Adventure capital for like the last 18 years the last 10 years of that has been in VC I feel like I've had the privilege of working on both sides of this business both on the VC side as an investor working with startups and also on the lp side investing into VC funds and co-investing along with them uh Sak Ventures is my baby it started it last year we're investing in seed stage companies all around the country fintech guys are are headquartered there um or if that's just kind of how everything kind of came about in your life uh so I'm originally from Tulsa Oklahoma and moved out of state my wife is from Oklahoma City and when we came here in 2010 you know it's just a place that's experienced like tremendous growth uh my previous job took me all around the country mainly in the Bay Area s La New York Chicago all over the place so we built this network all around the country and I think Co really opened up people's understanding to to realize that you can really build an amazing business or VC firm anywhere you are in before was that you actually have a guild Network which is to support founders with I found that to be so interesting so how do founders get to know and understand and how to work with this Guild Network and do they have to currently be in your portfolio company already how does that all work because it's something that I don't see everywhere so I found that to be particularly unique unlike most VCS and I'm generalizing because I don't know this I know that I don't know everything right and I I know it's a shocker to a lot of people I don't know everything so my feeling in in building out Sak Ventures was to find people who were really good at what they did whether that was something someone who's really need it so the guild meets on a quarterly basis and if there are touch points with Founders outside of those quarterly meetings where we invite a a potential company or an existing Sak company to do a 30 minute presentation to the guild and they get that feedback sometimes we're talking about contract negotiations sometimes we're talking about uiux things but overall the concept is get people the help that they need and that network has been phenomenal in doing that in fact today we have another guild meeting with a Founder that we are considering for the portfolio amazing that is so great and you know I I think that it goes to speak about how well you're building community and how Transcendent that is across the that the work that we already do with Founders it's just another value ad perfect um I know that you know the way that the market is would love to get your opinion on this that a lot of my VC friends that are usually in the associates or senior Associates or analysts they're all like very very highly ambitious very energetic people okay and um and you know you're actually one of the ones that I've actually seen come from another fun and then start your own fun because everyone and their mother wanted to start their own fun about two years ago right and so I was wondering what kind of things and learnings did you experience from when you actually made that leap that you know you kind of wish you knew then that I think a lot of our listeners would be look I told you this I think I kind of shed a little bit of color on it but not all the details and I may not go into all the details here on this call but I'm not super proud about the upbringing I had when I was a kid a lot of it wasn't my fault uh there's certain things about that that I was just embarrassed to talk to people about but I started to like psychologically look into all those different reasons and realize like oh that's my story so when I started sharing with LPS and others about like the why behind Sak Ventures the name and what it means to for me to actually do this role that's something that took me a while to embrace and I tell my wife all the time it's like man sarak has brought out something in me that I probably needed that that's resonated more with people so I would tell people if you're thinking about starting a fund make sure you integrate your personal story because people really are investing in you and then the fund secondary and you know that um as you are kind of going through that first fundraising stage that first you know incorporation of your fund and everything was there a pivotal moment where you had this moment of realization did something was there like an event that that happened or something that somebody had said um in your environment that really sunk in for sure there were there were two critical moments the first was our anchor invester Dera in and it kind of just shied my perspective like oh this is different and I thought that that was very unusual but at the same time something I'd always desired because there's always more behind the numbers there's always more behind people and she was like the first in investor ever to really get to the root of like who I was and am I the type of person that's going to have the grittiness and the resilience and the perseverance to actually build something great and she brought that out of me the second thing was I joined uh this program VC include and it's like a 10 or 12we program great people running that organization shout out to renell Solomon and all the people over there but they professionally and achievements I had yeah but people look at that as like a a given of course you're smart of course you understand how this works but tell me about you and why I should back you so that those were two critical moments that were early on in the life of the fun it's kind of like you're seeing that people are taking your performance as okay you've already gotten in the door and now what's that next step kind of a thing and tell me about you and tell me about you know this and so that's so interesting because I feel like I mean our industry is so opaque as it naturally has always been that's how a lot of funds have more advantages over than others but the same with the founders and so that's how you get different deal terms from one because I think that when things are very opaque and when you feel like you um come from a place that may be different than other people it is really hard to tell anything that makes you look vulnerable because it's like oh well okay you are the same performance level as X Y and Z other candidates for this but you have a black mark so what what what is that going to do with whoever is receiving that you know what I mean and I think that that makes it so scary for a lot of people um to kind of walk through these doors yeah and it's it's it's it's something that um when I talk to a founder or when we talk to Founders sort of been in the trenches developed that grittin and resilient resilience and can that be measured in a way that we can include it in our due diligence of that particular person so I came up with we were the Genesis of this sort of idea I was running it was in the winter time and I'm very disciplined with my workouts I don't ever Miss regardless of how hot it is how cold it is I woke up six o'clock in the morning there's snow all over the ground it's dark it's kind of drizzling because it had just snowed the night before and I'm about a m a mile into my run and my knee starts hurting and I was like why am I out here and I said oh I'm out here because I'm pretty revealing uh what it is so I find now that when we're talking to Founders like digging into who they are and really getting them to tell the truth about their why it's interesting and it makes it more a lot more comfortable to back those types of Founders when they're vulnerable with their weaknesses because in my opinion it makes them look stronger that's so interesting because yeah I mean that's naturally you wouldn't think that it's going to make you look stronger if you're saying something out of vulnerability and out of something that sounds very raw right um and and yeah and so it's really interesting that you say that and also uh you know that you said that you never miss a workout I literally missed my the founders that you've invested in you're like this is something that really stuck with me about their trait and how can I quantify this man it's almost like every single founder I'll tell you the very first investment that was made at Sak Ventures was into a Founder Carmel Cadet at mtech okay she grew up in Haiti Haiti is a very you know low very impoverished country and the environment that she grew up in was unlike any like you imagine the roughest environment in the United States and had is even worse so she moved to the United States when she was 16 went to college and then she ended up having this amazing career at IBM for 10 years when you hear these stories about these Founders and their resilience people begin people think that there's this Mutual exclusivity between uh people who want to do good but also build something great but it's like every single founder in our portfolio has a story like that and it's like of course you want to back these people because they're the type of people who are going to run through a brick wall to be successful and aren't going to quit no matter how difficult it gets so that's how we are that's how I am so when I see that trait in Founders you kind of just drawn to that yeah no I I completely get it and it's also really great that you know these are these are very globally impacting it's what it's what keeps me in this industry um working with great Founders and I think that that's something that you know we share and it's something that hopefully U more VCS will will share in the in the long term as well and be able to want to stay in this kind of environment and Industry and utilize your skill set for Good Hope yeah and I think that let's put on our investor hats for a moment I feel like the way you make money as an investor is you have to figure out where the opportunities are on the edges where there's some sort of at asymmetric advantage that Founders give or something that you're doing for investors and I feel like by targeting very homogeneous and everyone seemed to be doing the same thing and I kind of got tired of that and I said there's an opportunity here that everybody's ignoring so we're going to build something different to capture that so I think that as an investor like a portfolio manager VC you have to sort of think about that and include those things are going to create Alpha for your investors and I think that that that that's a big one yeah and you know uh adding on to that as well like you know we talked about how you have um this great network of of guilds that you have provided um other startups and Founders the missing parts that they needed right and I always found that it was so interesting that especially a lot outside of the box thinking and help that other Founders would really need so I really do love that you guys really do help build instead of just being like Hunters everywhere because there are a lot of hunters um already and I don't know that that's really the skill set that people are going to be building on to in the future as great investors become more and more advanced if that makes sense to you yeah yeah I totally agree you know there's a a person I know here who's a phenomenal investor won't say his name but he said something years ago probably five six seven years ago that I that stuck with me he was like the reason I think I've been successful is because he's so good at getting to interesting and I as I we were thinking I think about this with do diligence with Founders we were on a call yesterday with a Founder that got actually got kind of contentious to a point but what we were ultimately trying to understand was like why he was making a certain type of decision we didn't stop pushing into it until he finally just revealed what it was and at the end of that we said to him now we're comfortable with potentially backing you because now we understand you as a person and why you're doing things the way you're doing cuz people like dance around the beauty of all this stuff instead of just really digging in and I think that that's something I've learned good Steward of the capital that people are giving us to invest on their behalf and this isn't play money this is millions of dollars that we're managing for people and we take that very seriously perfect and you know I I think that when someone asked me why I wanted to be a venture C I was really bad at the whole dancing thing I don't know all the waltes I didn't know any of the steps it felt and you know and some of the rules of these other kinds of types of organizations I love when a VC's job is to dig in is to ask the hard questions and is to be as straightforward as possible when you're doing the due diligence but also when you are helping them build post support like post investment support and providing okay what is that next step opinions about it too was about asking for help how do you provide help to somebody who does not know what they need as a Founder because if you're a firsttime you don't really know what you don't know because you haven't been in that other step that other step yet so you know um to to allow people to know that you're available but to also um know how and when to check in I'm sure is something that is really important to your strategy I think if we go a little bit deeper none of us know everything and I I fundamentally believe that and I feel like if you're working with the right founder then they have the humility to understand that there's an expectation on my behalf on my part that I know feel like you don't need anyone's help you're the a a master at it which is great and you're probably not even you don't need Venture Capital but I think for most people at Seed where we're investing they do have some domain expertise in what they're doing however there's more to just that than growing a high growth company so when founders don't know what they need we know to a certain extent that they don't know that and the way that we want to work with them is are they coachable enough to accept the assistance from our Network our team members our Guild and if we can't do that and there they don't want to work with us in that capacity then we're probably not the right no I'm not flags that are immediate red flags to you so for us it would be actually hard number criteria so if you have already come in at preed or seed with a messy cap table already and you have like so many different advisers that have taken so much different equity and all of that stuff or um if you came from a venture Studio fund that let's say didn't really help you in the way that you thought but again it went back to that messy cap table situation and the valuation is very different than what we can expect or the valuation cap is different than what we can possibly provide these are kind of automatic disqualifiers do you guys have automatic disqualifiers um that you have come across in your first fund absolutely I mean I mean I could doesn't make any sense or I mean I'll give you an example actually not an example more of a characteristic because the way that we run our fund and the parameters that we set by way of we want to see X number of months months over month Revenue sometimes that's three months months month-over-month Revenue growth sometimes it's six month months of month over month Revenue that's kind of hard anyway um we have things like that we have valuation limits such that we don't want to invest in rounds that are post money valuation of 15 million or or higher we want to see round sizes that are below 3 million we want to see cacs at this and ltvs at that we have all those sort of standard you're going to need to make adjustments in real time but again this goes back to what we're talking about from the very beginning is does is this the type of founder that we want to back and I try to stress this so much we can change the business the Market's going to change yep one thing that we cannot change is the founder unless the company's going well and we fire the CEO and they leave but I think that because we're investing at seed a lot of emphasis is put on them and kind of how they think about building companies and we can fill in the gaps with all the other things but I think a lot of it has to still come back to them and you know somebody told me this once and I never forgot it how like if of why people are in uh saying it like that so when investors are saying well it's about the founder it's about you know all these characteristics that are vague and positive like a horoscope you know uh and then I'm like no I need this kind of proof this kind of proof this kind of proof and uh and then it seems like everything that you can possibly say can be said about all the different snowflakes in the world and everyone is special and so um to provide a little bit more color can you kind of expand about like that it's about the founder and you know what is what does that really mean to you uh versus you know how do other investors kind of explain it in a general sense uh I mean it's a good question I is one thing and you got to have the right founder in the right Market at the right time that's right yeah sometimes it can be the right founder but the Market's not ready yet or it can be the right market right timing but the wrong founder so unless you have those three core ingredients it's just not going to work so it's not just about the founder all the time I also think that as a firm thematically they have to fit within the categories where we're good at like we love fintech we love Enterprise SAS we're looking at a lot of cyber security and embedded finance and looking at some things in the Commerce enablement space with creators and future work if there's are you do have actual focuses yeah I think that investing is about creating Frameworks yeah and if anyone's a fan of Ray Doo it's me who has these core set of principles that he lives by them right and those principles are guides that help you to stay in your lane so that you don't get off track both personally professionally financially spiritually or whatever it might be what are those principles so I feel like I've always been a good investor and the reason I think that is because I create these Frameworks for whatever medium I'm looking at at the that fit within that okay perfect awesome well thank you so much Kevin that is a wrap for our episode and thank you everyone for joining us on another episode of unlocking Venture Capital I'm here with Kevin Moore and our next episode is going to come out on Monday so thank you so much my pleasure thank you"

With a background in finance and a passion for startups, more empowers the next generation of venture capitalists. We're very excited to have you here today. Man, I'm excited to talk with you because not only are you fantastic in this space, but you also written a book and we're going to break into that book today because we want to figure out all these great nuggets that you've learned, but tie that right back into how the startup world works because all this material really does align so nicely to you for so much for letting me be here. It's a pleasure. Um maybe I'll just give a brief intro on my background. Um I feel like I'm a very non-traditional venture capitalist because I got my degree in civil engineering. I live in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, right here in the middle of the United States. But I've been blessed with opportunities to do this wonderful job and to back a lot of different companies. And you know, I started out with this curiosity as a kid of entrepreneurship and what it meant. My first sort of experience selling things to try to make money was gathering items from around our house and putting them on our front yard to have a little garage sale. I was graduated college and moved to Chicago, I started a t-shirt company called Urban Necessity and we were selling urban clothing and artwork and all these different things, but just whatever you could do on the side to sort of scratch that itch. I graduated, moved to Chicago, was working as an engineer for a couple of years, knew this wasn't what I wasn't supposed to be doing, and then I graduated into or moved into financial services, thinking that this would be the launch pad for learning more and getting into venture capital eventually. So I did that for a few years, worked in financial services for six year, eight actually eight years and then moved into venture capital where I've worked now Uh, that's a great story and I was smiling because I I literally was sharing this story a few days ago where um was sharing about when I was a kid, my parents told me that I took all of my sandbox toys and went down to the beach and sold them all at the flea market. So um when you were saying you were selling stuff around the house, apparently I was doing the same thing. So I thought there was an opportunity there to help, so I better go and make some money. Um, and uh I was very uh I guess it's um uh can't remember what the term would be called, but thrifty. So, uh that's how I bought my parents' birthday gifts was uh to retake uh my toys, sell them, and then maybe find something and rewrap that and give them it as a gift. So, I guess our entrepreneurial spirit started anything because you don't even realize you're doing it, but you're like, I just needed a few bucks to do X and whatever that X was, it made it interesting. But I can only imagine in your t-shirt business if you would have kept it going. Who knows, today that could have been uh one of the largest urban t-shirt companies in Oklahoma or in Chicago area. Who knows? But it's funny how we don't always keep behind the drive of things that we're passionate for. We use them as a vehicle for the timing and then we kind of keep moving on. My wife and I talk about this all the time because it was our first year, our second full year of marriage and we were both sort of just we had a lot of free time and this was at a time and not to date myself when e-commerce and online shopping wasn't really that big of a desire to do something independently and venture capital and entrepreneurship and everything that people talk about on the show and what we see every day JP is is that and that is fun in of itself. I totally agree with that. And you know, you have to start somewhere. And the cool thing is is that your experiences and my experiences are you know something really small, something gritty. You just went out and tried it to see what the outcome would be. uh you got the the the niche for it because now you figured out I can make money if I just try and do something and it doesn't matter if it comes easily. It's just the fact that I have the switch that I can turn on and I can figure out how to balance things out when I need to. And I think when you kind of take back to some of your experience in uh the space that you worked in, what I liked about it is that one you have that entrepreneurial of how finance works. I think it's the most daunting scariest thing to most. Um but you spent a good eight years working in finance. Is there something there that you could say, you know, I took these learnings and they've really impacted how I work with founders, how I work with people. Um, and is it that every founder you work with is just gang busters for numbers, or it's the complete opposite and you tend to be pushing them more on how to uh report and share back information to uh to other GPS and LPS and their and their investments? I like this question because the engineering side of me made it such that I was very comfortable working with numbers. So the financial side of it didn't bother me. What I learned probably the most working in financial services was how to work just about numbers. It was about people and the ability to develop relationships. And a lot of that has to do with business development. So whenever I left the engineering job and went to work in finance, that first role that I took was 100% commission and I was selling a combination of insurance and investments. And one of the things that they taught us was about the statistics behind how you actually built a business which were your clients and just following the numbers and having the discipline to do that on a daily basis like without without uh without excuses and that was really a that was a was just no skill, just straight up discipline and hard work. And you're learning all the other things on the side about like how to invest and put together portfolios. But I think as it relates to venture capital as a GP and as GPS, we are selling ourselves to investors. We're selling ourselves to founders and there's different numbers that go along with that to to ensure success. We are also uh I also think that understanding the financial component of the industry at large is you understand and see that they're intrinsically related. The public markets and the private markets they all play together. And I don't think that I would have fully understood that had I sort of just ideas and frameworks that can be applied to whatever medium within sort of different industries, private equity, venture capital, hedge funds, whatever that you kind of get familiar with and you start to implement when you have to do it when you're building something like a venture capital firm for yourself. So I could talk a lot more about that cuz it is it is interesting and I am very thankful for that experience. I love it because you you actually took a different angle on how the financial space benefited you than what I would have expected you to say like, \"Hey, being in finance, I learned about finance. I learned about those things, but you were already comfortable. You were already working in that mix. So, because you literally took something that you already knew, stepped into a space that you weren't comfortable with, and you got thrown into the call it into the den because you literally had to learn everything all in one shot. You're like, I already know finance, but I don't know how to sell. I don't know how to sell in this type of environment, and if I don't sell, I don't get paid, and I don't make any money, and this isn't going to be worth it to anybody. Um, and you're obviously going newly married, you're going through all these things, you've got a lot more costs and things that you have to step up to to make sure you can manage. So, I just love the fact that you took a different approach to it and said, \"I had to learn way different skills.\" And in that those learning those skills are kind of what actually helped you move forward. And the biggest one it sounds like is you learned how to work within frameworks, which is putting together a process that was simple and clean. And the reason why I'm bringing uh pumps here, but the other thing I loved about it is that at the end of each chapter, you had actionable items. I think every book should have that. like it's almost like a little synopsis of here's what you just read in case you forgot everything that you just read and here's a couple of points that are really going to stand out and start taking notes and make some action items here because this is how you're going to move forward. So I just love the fact that everything rounded out each time. So you built a framework on how you walk through each process to get to raising money. You walk through each process on how you are going to close a deal in your working in finance. So I just love that because the framework is what makes this work. If you have no framework, you'll just go in circles. Yeah, absolutely. And I think that just going back to something you said earlier down complicated things in ways that normal people can understand them. whether it's a founder, whether it's an investor, whether it's anybody. And I think that if you understand kind of the the process of solving problems like most people, especially in my previous life as an engineer, that's what we were taught to do. And processes and things of that sort were we followed those because we understood that it's the framework that sort of drives the outcome, not the other way around. And just to emphasize that even more, there are design principles. There are invest investment principles that apply. And if you can structure that in a way that it makes sense, it can be applied to was the process of evaluating an opportunity, putting together a portfolio, understanding and doing the diligence, understanding who the stakeholders are, who's interested in investing in that strategy. Ultimately, my interests are investing into early stage companies. But having that perspective of seeing that side of the business has been tremendously beneficial as a GP. But again as an investor I think that that concept can be applied to anything whether it's real estate whether it's investing in the public markets etc etc so frameworks are a really big thing to me and it it shows and I and I like I said I really enjoyed walking through the framework and as an into the book a bit more uh you know there was um a couple of concepts say in each area that I want to just touch briefly on because I think it really relates to how startups operate. So like you could take your book and change everything from how to build a fund to how to build a startup and it would be the exact same thing. So I only take 10% royalty on that change over of your book. So basically the concept um the concept that I liked was at the beginning you talked about a thesis and you said come up with a thesis. Well for me from a startup perspective this is come up with your hypothesis on the problem you're trying to solve which is identical to what that thesis is. And what I loved about your thesis, and I'm not sure if you um had gone back and looked at this, supposed to take away all the fluff and just get you to the point. Um, Bitcoin usage will become ubiquitous, eliminating the need for cash for purchasing products. Period. Add in some other words, but give or take. This is what you share. And it's perfect because it literally says, \"My hypothesis is this, and I'm going to go after this because this what I think is going to change the world.\" And then you focus on that. Maybe there's going to be pre and post comments that will circle around that thesis, but maybe you can talk a little bit about um some of the learnings that you had from when you really refining this thesis because it's like refining your hypothesis of your people probably didn't even know what Bitcoin was to to the point that they do today. And look how relevant that is getting because of that thesis. And if everything was invested in that category, you know, would you have been a leader in that category for that comment? So, it's pretty fascinating on how you derived this and then the outcome. Um, and you added in a few elements like avoid large funds and you came up with some elements that help you better focus this thesis. Can you share a little bit about why this is so crucial to a founder when they're building their company? I think that whenever I'm talking with a founder, their thesis to me is important profitable sort of opportunity for you? And their ability to explain that reinforces their thesis. If the thesis is we're going to be living on the moon in five years because the planet Earth is going to be destroyed by climate change. Okay. Well, that's a great thesis, but tell me why you think that's going to happen and the justification behind that is kind of more important than what the thesis is in general. But I think that it's just fundamental to when you're asking somebody for money, Mr. or Mrs. founder, having that thesis support is critically important. And I'm not a scientist, but again, back to the might be. It just so happens by happen stance that I've been studying Bitcoin. I own Bitcoin. our fund doesn't really invest in sort of Bitcoin as it right now, but my thesis was I felt like that would be something that would be um useful in the future, mainly more of the decentralization side of that. But I think those were just examples of things I was thinking at the time when I wrote the book that I was sort of thinking about. And look, your thesis could be wrong and there's no certainty that it's going to happen. But more importantly is a structure of like how did you develop that? In fact, as as we were talking before the the blog uh podcast, I was writing a blog about portfolio it? To me, that's what matters and that's what gives an investor confidence to invest in you when you're talking to them about your company. No, that's that's gold. I I I think it helps you align your brain to, as you mentioned, the why, but the justification to the point of what that thesis is. So if you can justify it and everybody else can believe in the way you've justified it, then people will want to invest because they will also believe the world is flat or the world is going to blow up in the next 5 years because you've created such an argument that it's almost inevitable that this will happen. Regardless if it does, you've created enough backdrop information, justified it, and you're proving your thesis. And regardless, some great companies and we've got a lot of great companies in our portfolio. So now you kind of take that rounding side of things and you say, well, now that we started and we start to have these companies, we're investing in them. you know you go into metrics and the metrics can be kind of opened up to many things but I think this is where the shortcomings of founders are is maybe it's on the numbers side maybe it's the understanding side but you talk about things like well how do I know you can prove to me that this is going to work so you've got things from DPI to deal flow um how you're going to invest types of founders so is there a criteria that you look at today and did it shift from 10 years ago doing it. So, I'm going after the med school uh PhDs. like have you kind of continued to refine your KPIs and your metrics just as a founder should when they're out pitching for for money or for pitching in general? For sure. One of the things that I think is important as an investor is to certainly you want to be in line with whatever trend is happening but more than a trend more sustainable trend. One of the things that we think about at Sarra Ventures is investing in areas or into products or services that are going to always be in some sort of demand. And there's innovation that happens within those specific categories. For example, we around and it's always going to be there. There's no fear in my mind that the fintech industry is going to fail and not be relevant. That's just in my opinion not going to happen. We don't invest in medicine, but I'm just giving another example. People are always going to have issues with their health. It is always going to happen. So that category is always going to be there. However, bads change. So we're not investing in things that are temporary. So just as this relates to a founder, perhaps there's a period or window of time when things are more relevant than others. And you can look back in history across technology and see that happen. But also there's the opportunity to, you know, categories of technologies and products that there was no sort of what might this be but they created new categories. When you think about Henry Ford for example, Henry Ford created or sort of industrialized the automobile. But at that time there was no infrastructure to support that. There were no like gas stations all over the country, service stations, how are you going to get fuel to different places? All of that stuff had to be created that infrastructure for all those different things. But the automobile fundamentally changed the way that we uh track travel, logistics, everything. So you don't have to figure out everything. But that's a new category defining technology. So there's think AI is probably one of those as well. And that's another deep you we could do a podcast just on that topic. But again, I think I'm getting the point across here. No, agreed. And and I think when you start to figure out what that fat is, it's like a bad shirt versus, you know, it looks great today, but it's not going to look very good in a week or two once you've kind of got used to the bad colors or whatever it is. So, it's the same idea. It's trying to figure out where that's going to take us and can will someone buy this and will it be a staple product in the next 5 years and will it be again in the 10 years from now or will that innovation go a step further. So you'll be obsolete in 5 years or 10 years because the technology is going to get picked up on and it's going to be even uh different where there won't be vehicles anymore. It's just going to be flying and it's going that there's going to be this shift that they're now trying to put out there because they want people to start believing that ah my mobile phone ah I don't like it and then all of a sudden this new tech's going to come out it'll be Google Glass or whatever metaglass but the whole idea is I have to start feeding the brain today so that you start to believe it so that in the next 5 years you'll want to remove this phone because it's nothing but cumbersome. So they'll start to sell that through so they can have a new category and open up the door for something bigger. So you know you start to tie in these facets of um sales techniques um how you get the deal flow, how you as a startup is going to generate and make this a business. And then some of the other things you touch on which again I think this is something that's got to be like stamped everywhere is you talk about accounting, legal and reporting. And from a venture of a startup sharing this information to their investors? Um, do you have any ways that you work with founders to get them to be more alerted to the fact that this will benefit them to share out um and get this off their chest and do it on a regular basis? uh you know it it seems to be like I said when you went into the deep dive in the book it's like that aha totally agree I I'd like every founder to believe this but where's the shortcomings on this I certainly think that founders don't have to be experts at all those different things but I think that as a CEO of a company you should have some sort of awareness of how those things work one of the things that technology has helped and also accelerated is the number of companies that are in the market where there are business. However, it's important to understand how to read a financial statement, what legal entity documents are important, how to lead a team meeting, and how to motivate and lead your employees, like just basic things. There are a lot of technical founders and some people who are really good at just their product or their service or they're really good at sales. And as companies mature, and we've both seen this, sometimes that person who started the company might stay in that role and you bring in someone with that skill set who understands all the different elements of a business. When you look at large Fortune 500s or just larger companies, often time the CEO is someone who was the COO. And the COO typically looking at deals and they start out partnering in partnering and like investing in the deals or maybe they start out as an analyst and they're doing all different things within a company or you might have someone who was a chief of staff or an IR person who understood a certain part of the business now they're helping with investments. But I feel like as a GP, we can either a outsource all of that or b just have a general understanding of it so we know what we're getting. And as a founder, I think it's the same thing. One of the things I I wanted to also touch on in the book that I hope we don't leave out is the market validation piece. One of the things that I was taught starting out in financial services was trying to get an have a market to sell these products? And we do the same thing as VCs. I did the same thing in starting the first fund I ever started. I spent literally six months hardcore just talking to people about does this make sense? Here's the thesis. Here's what we're trying to do. Same thing with Sarak Ventures. I went out and talked to a bunch of people before figuring out should should I even launch this? And founders should do the same thing. They should spend time actually talking to their customers. Case study. Here's an example. I was working with a founder and I was talking to this founder about their product and some of the issues yet. And I said, 'You haven't went literally went to their office, sat down with them and collected this data. And that was a huge red flag. But I think that we live in this society where people rely so much on the less face-to-face sort of information gathering. And I think you're missing something from that. Not that you can't get sufficient information, but the lack of investigation by some people is alarming. And when conducting due diligence, it's important to understand that not just for me to a founder, but also from an investor looking at Sarak Ventures or someone looking at your fund or whoever. So I think that the market validation piece is something that uh is interest to solve the problem. And and maybe this falls a lot more on venture where or investors, angels or uh LPs that they have to do more investigation to ensure that this has merit and has value and that not everybody's bought into just the idea and the concept, but that there is some form of market validation uh versus it just being a hunch. And and I think to your point, there's a lot of hunches and people are just going with them because they all feel the same hunch, but they haven't investigated if someone would actually change an entire industry over to work off of this type of product or are they too early or are they too late? There's probably lots of different ways that that could structured into that. Yeah. And again, I always like to think, you know, not some of this stuff to me is or is this a problem for a greater magnitude of people. Such a good point. I think about that all the time. And one of the ways in conducting due diligence to figure that out is asking a founder, why did you start your company? And if their answer is something like, well, I wanted to go out on my own and build something for my family or I did I wanted to do this because I want to be independent. I don't want to have a boss. I'm like, that's the that's not a that's not that's your that's that's an answer, but it's not the right answer. The right answer is I saw this huge problem out there that needed to be fixed and I just couldn't I couldn't deal with myself if earlier comment you made, they spent 6 months diving into it to prove that there was a real problem there versus um seeing it, then you've got the full solution that they did all the pre-work, they did everything they could and they're coming back to you and saying, \"Look, I know there's a market here. I've proven it. I went out. I hustled. I found the problem. I found the gap and my hypothesis was correct. There's a problem and here's my solution to the problem I came up with.\" You know, I was talking to a founder la me last week and probably one of the most impressive things I've ever heard. He said he conducted diligence on uh he had a problem that he thought he sent out uh interview requests to a thousand people build a company is get a customer, then build the problem versus, you know, build a solution and then go out looking for customers. It just showed so much maturity and I wish more founders would do that. I love it. Agreed. Well, to kind of wrap up the the the structure of the book and all the great things that it kind of aligns you to and I will tell everybody you have to read this because it it's a great framework for either starting a company, starting a fund, but it really does help on all fronts. Um, you know, we kind of walk through market validation. You've got accounting, legal reporting, metrics, uh, thesis. And the last one that it kind of really touches big things and they say, well, venture wants to see this. Yeah, sure. But what is its really possibilities? What is the real value? What have you tested to prove that you think you could actually do in numbers? So there's that side of it. What are the expectations? And then what are the roles that venture fits into helping companies, angels, LPs, venture people? What are their roles in helping these companies actually achieve these goals? Like where do you see that um the fit there? Because I think we all want to just be in there helping like crazy, but is that really going to validate and bring value to the founder and to their company or, you know, what's the recommendation? What's the best way for my money to be successful? Because I'm literally giving you think as VCs the best thing that we can do for companies is use our experience to provide examples of what works and what doesn't work. We cannot go into every company and operate their company. Nor can we be expected to be experts at the things that they're super passionate about. I have a general understanding and sort of deep knowledge of the financial services industry even the regulatory side of that. So whenever I'm talking to fintech founders and companies that might have some sort of embedded finance component I'm able to talk to them about that consumer behaviors what's happening on the regulatory front. Does this make sense for customers? They benefit from that can do things like recruiting. They can even introduce people to customers or even other investors. I think that what we spend the most time doing is introducing our portfolio companies to other VCs who might want to invest in them and then scouring our personal networks to introduce them to potential customers. We also have some advisors within our network that will work with our portfolio companies to give them different things. But at the end of the day, the founder has to run the business and they don't have to take our advice. We're just there as another resource. And realistically, we think of of ourselves as as valuable as like other their company, and then trusting them to make the right decision. I like that it's a simple approach, but it's there when they need it. It's uh it's an open vault when they choose to come back and get the information, which is super helpful. And I guess in a way, you're saying know your lane. Figure out what your lane is and how you're going to support those companies. Make sure that they know if it's recruiting or if it's uh advising help, whatever it is, but know your lane so that when they do have a problem, they know who to come with because they've learned that over time through how you've proceeded in your investment with them. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's um it's a fun fun job, I'll tell you, seeing all the different technologies and the ideas, but the biggest thing is just test the market, their execution was limited. So in this case, execution wins the race. It's the best executors will move the product or fail it. And I've seen guys that uh gentleman that ran a company and he literally raised millions of dollars, went out to the market, was testing it, and said, you know what, this isn't working. I can't get anybody to take on it. So instead of spending more money and wasting the time, I'm going to fold the company and give everybody back what's left of the of the funding. And huge respect for that because they thought that there was a big problem there. They went after it and they couldn't solve it. So execution was everything in that case. Does that mean in 10 years from now it might be something bigger? For sure. But at least they stuck to their their uh drive and they tried to solve it and it wouldn't work. So instead of just burning out time for the next three, four years, back and walk away and try something different. Yeah, I respect that the maturity to be able to do that. That's huge. Agreed. Well, now we're going to jump just before we jump into the 60 spot. I have to ask this question because I'm a fan. So, is there a chapter? Is there a section of the book that you would move to the front, make it bigger, or is there a section you would say, you know what, I wish I put this in when I do version two of the book. I'm going to add in this new area because you've got eight, seven and eight years of learning from when you started writing to when you published to where you are today. Is there a section that you would add more to it or that you would put in a new chapter and say, you know what, I learned a lot about this. I'm going to fund manager, what I would I would add a chapter or a few chapters about the following, and I learned this from experience over time. the four elements of the four critical areas of of running a venture capital firm. That would be like the title of this entire section. It's fundraising, operations, general marketing for the firm, and then working with founders. those four categories. As a GP, you think or I guess most people on the outside think that all we do is work with founders, but in running a firm, we're thinking and things of that sort. And then sometimes you're focusing on streamlining your internal operations. But all those different things have to be working together. And when I wrote that book, I had just raised that was my first fund. And I was so frustrated with the process of not understanding how to do it and piecing it together that I thought, oh, this could be a good resource for other people. But now having done that a few times, uh you understand in running a fund is no different than running a company. There are four functional areas. If you're a founder, your fundraising might be your for us, that's sort of our our source of of capital. It's the thing that we use to actually do business. For a founder, it might be their product. We have to have operations. So does a founder. We by which we attract our investors to the fund. And for individual company their product could be some new technology. So I think that from a I I would add to the book the business side of running a venture capital firm to fill that out. I just haven't had the energy to go back and add that in there. No, that's great. it like it you kind of uh you know if if I was s had to to add to your book I would add in the governance side but everything else to me was like a great homogeneous structure and if you added in that part you just talked about which is the fundamentals and the fundraising operations general and the the startup founder I I I think you just keep building on that you've got a fantastic thank you for sharing that. So I think um next we'll jump into this 60-cond rant. So the way this works is you have 60 seconds. You'll rant about anything. I'll hit start and nobody has ever hit 60 seconds. So no pressure on that. Um and again it's to rant about anything. I will try and um disagree with your rant. never works because I'm always a big fan of the rents and I agree with them. So, I will share and then you can end it off. But, uh, when you're ready, 60 seconds, you're on. This is an easy one. One of the things that is a pet peeve of mine is when I hear any investor say that they knew that a particular company was going to be a huge success. There's absolutely no way you could know that. know which ones that's going to be. So when I see people taking credit for like these big massive wins, I think the credit should be like, you know, I didn't know that this company was going to end up like that, but I am pretty confident about our strategy as a firm to create the opportunity for that to happen. But there's no way that anybody could know. So that's just that's my rant. That's that's my one of my pet peeves. Well, I like it because you also came in at 60 seconds. So, bam, first person I think that's hit the hit the number right on. So, that's awesome. Um, I I will I won't counter it because I do agree with you wholeheartedly that it's feels like it's a game of luck. But now, if we take the way that you're and you transportation, whatever it might be, AI, all of these areas, and that's the focus of of how you're going to generate over the next 10 years. So in a portfolio creation, when it comes to these big hits, it's one, you have to get into these companies at a certain point to be able to have that investment to say you got in there. So somehow you have to figure out how to get in there in the first place. And then secondarily, how it matches up because if you're only investing in AI companies and this happens to be a CPG company, then what are you doing in that as well? Because it seems that in earlier stage company portfolios, people want you to only invest in a specific segment. It's not that you can just invest in all companies everywhere because nobody can do everything great. So, how do you manage all of this? because I think it is a one-hit wonder to your point and guess that what what what I was writing about was how important portfolio construction is and I illustrate how you can actually invest in too few companies and you can have a strategy where you invest in too many. And what portfolio construction demonstrates is that you actually have a strategy for actually hitting or increasing the probability of hitting your desired returns. So again, it's highly debatable the number of companies that people should invest in or what sectors are going to drive that. But I think fundamentally it's just the framework for how you build a portfolio that matters to investors. And look, they ask about it. They ask about it Agreed. And I like that you also threw in there that it's about the returns. The at the end result is I'm building a portfolio that's going to generate bigger returns than you would get if you went to the stock market. So you do have to figure out how you're offsetting the regular 8 to 12% uh increase on the TSX or the Venture or the NASDAQ etc. the Dow. So you have to prove how that's going to be possible through the investments, through the thesis and through the things you're investing in. So I agree it all comes back down to the fundamentals. You kind of have to take the lofty throw out there and uh the Hail Mary to toss because that's what you're going to win with. But you got to try and use the fundamentals that approve why this is going to be a profitable and valuable um portfolio. Absolutely. I love it. Well, we're almost there. couple of questions as well, so you can uh jump on those at the same time. Um all right, here we go. From your investment thesis and standpoint, would you rather invest in a founder or co-founder? Founder. Unicorn or a 4-year 10x exit? Fouryear. AI or blockchain? AI. First money in or series A? First money in. Board seat or observer? Observer. Discipline. Vision. verticals of focus in your fund. Fintech, SAS, future work. Love it. Number of companies invested per year. 8 to 10. Love it. Even more. Favorite part of investing? Watching companies progress and grow. that it's not the end outcome, it's the journey of seeing that happen. I like it. What is the piece of advice you give founders nine out of 10 just be humble and willing to iterate because everyone wants the end goal to succeed. Who is your hero, mentor, and why? hero, mentor. It's probably people I've never met, but the first person that comes to mind is Steve Schwarzman, who started Black Rockck, I think that's his name. His story of hustle and grit and drive and determination, it's very motivating to me. I appreciate his book. I like it. that there's opportunity everywhere and it's often found in places where people aren't looking. Like it. Now, this is a two-parter question. You don't have to use names, but choose what's best. What is your worst investment and your favorite investment or the same? I think the worst investment [Music] are founders who keep coming back to the pot for more money without a specific strategy on how how they're going to use that. I've seen that happen so many references to podcasts or other areas that you collect information from that you think would be useful to founders or investors? I'm less of a listener and more of a reader. I read about two books a month. I try to read one book that's more like professional development and then another book that's about biographies about other people who started companies. There's so many good ones. Like I read Richard Branson's story, Steve Schwarzman's story, um Phil Knight at at at Nike. I've read all these different books and then I'll try to read a book about business. I think that ask you what Oh, maybe I will. What's your favorite book? We'll go to the personal questions now. Favorite book, man. I still think that the best one of the best books I've ever read is Shoe Dog by Phil Knight. Um, you know, I also like Good to Great. It sat on my shelf for 10 years and I didn't read it thinking that I don't really care about this book, but then I finally read it. It was really one of those good one of those books. But then I'm reading I read another book recently called Buy Back Your Time by Dan Martell. Phenomenal book. Uh then I read uh is it Greg M Cohen who wrote essentialism phenomenal book um I mean I could I'm just looking at my bookshelf so many Richard who he was on this show called undercover billionaire and he built a massive uh lending company that went through all the GFC and all those different things. Incred incredible story. I could go on and on. I love it. These are very valuable. I love it. Um big fan of I've read a few of those, but now I've got more to read, so I'm going to get on those, too. Um favorite sports team? Oklahoma City Thunder, obviously. Yeah, they are pretty pretty good. uh favorite movie and what character would you play? Man, it's maybe because of this recency bias. My favorite movie is uh Born We'll we'll cut this snippet off and send it over to the uh to the uh FBI or something and see if we can get you in there. I love it. I'm a big fan. I rewatched that about probably during co I remember rewatching the whole series. So, I agree. It's pretty sick. It's so good. Yeah. Uh cake or fortune cookie? Cake. Superman or Batman? Superman. DC or Marvel? Definitely Marvel. Come on. Well, you did pick Superman, so I know that's a little bit of a jump position. Yeah, that's our nerds coming out right now, but I'm just let it slide. Yeah. Oprah because she's a pacifier and Elon's everywhere now. Like pretty soon he's going to be on the cereal box and he's going to be in my house hanging out. It's uh it's crazy how much uh this guy's moving around. Uh all right, Big Mac or Chicken McNuggets. McNuggets. I like it. All right, we're down to the wire. What is your superpower? uh my superpower like hidden talent things that people don't know about me you know when I was in college I used to cut hair and I did that as like a side business I learned I started doing it when I was 15 and just kept doing it and bought my wife's first wedding don't get to use it much in my work but I enjoy it and I wouldn't call it a superpower but it does take a lot of discipline to maintain it. Ah that's brilliant and and I'm glad that you brought that up so that we could end the segment with knowing your superpower but also knowing one thing about you that nobody would know. So that's brilliant. Um, and I'm gonna say Kevin, it's been an honor and a pleasure to not only get to know you and hang out with you in the Middle East, but to be sitting here today and and going through your book and going through everything about yourself and the way uh you look at things, I can say your superpower also on top of that is uh you're good with people and uh you're certainly sharp and uh you can share a lot of value. So, it's been a real pleasure getting to talk with you today and thank you for"

        "full_transcript": "before in my entire life I played High School sports I've played division 2 basketball I've done a lot of things that required like a lot of discipline but this is like no [Music] other hey everyone uh Welcome to our first episode of Alone Together uh this is the first podcast uh that talks about solo GPS in the Venture community at least the one I've done uh I'm Mike Ma I'm managing partner of a newly minted fund uh that we just our first close at side cut Ventures and and I really when I did this I wanted to start talking to other solo GPS who are doing what I'm really just chop it up and give an honest unfetter talk about the stuff that we go through uh it couldn't be a better person to to chat with first than my friend Kevin Moore uh as Ventures um and I've known Kevin for a couple years I think my favorite story story to think about us is when we were at um when we were at culture shift and you were afraid you weren't going to make your flight home and there was a good chance that you're were gonna come stay with my house to like come crash with the family um so it's with that was is with that thought uh that I was really excited when I thought about the podcast about doing this I just send you a text like hey would you do this and you said hell yeah guest no thank you for having me I do remember that story and I never ever had problems flying in or out of New York maybe one time because of the weather but usually it's been pretty smooth yeah well I don't know what was going on that weather that day but it was it was something I was just I remember like did you get homeo and you know what was really cool about this this sets up the um I think this sets up the the podcast uh we knew each other as people before investors and what's been really cool in in the year and a half or two years I don't even remember since we've actually co-invested in some deals uh we've talked fundraising and I I consider you community so I just thought uh we would just have a conversation and just kind of talk about uh what you're building not so much to like pitch and why I'm so good and do chest beating but just to have an honest conversation about uh what's going on and uh and give people an inside look under the covers no I like that I I've been toying around with a Blog D sitting in my blog sort of cat catalog of this sort of movement of solo GPS and is this the new thing and what are the benefits pros and cons of that I think was it stepstone who wrote a paper about this as well I've been thinking about it quite a bit so if we can discuss that that'd be cool different things so it's a great idea to start something like this because we're goingon to you're going to hear a lot of different stories of how people think about this life completely I'm here for it so let let let me jump in with that with you talking about this life tell me about your life like tell me about prak just what in God's name Led you in your life to to this little part and go back far back as you want on this because I always think this is a when you say being a solo GP is tough or like a Founder I think it's like at least the fundraise process has been like stabbing myself in the eye so I'm always curious what have you done in your life to deserve this lot you know I'm reading this book that talks about people who had like experiencing turbulence and my career life is always comparative to the feelings that I had when I was growing up when I graduated from college I went to work in financial services and that wasn't my first career I'm very non-traditional VC I got my degree in civil engineering and then I went into Finance wanting to help people you know I didn't grow up with a lot of money so I wanted to help people manage theirs and that was really empowering so did that for like six years then I went into more a regulatory like government style job working at the Federal Reserve Bank which was really a pause to think and reflect on what I really wanted to do long term and that was returned to this years at a VC firm here in Oklahoma City where I'm at then I went to work on the institutional side learned a little bit about how fund of funds works and just institutional investors and then got to a point where I felt like I'd learned enough to start my own firm and take this approach to doing something different that other people in the industry weren't and that was the that was the that's the short story history of Sak Ventures and to now actually be doing it is the realization of a dream that started like almost 20 years ago it's wild you you said um VC tried Tech The Tick the boxes that PE did can you say more about what some of the Facebook allocated so people could invest in that company the Brokers running around the office like chickens with their heads cut off trying to figure out how they're going to get an allocation for their clients and when Tesla was like $30 and looking at all these tech companies and whenever I started investing my own money years ago I was mainly focused on technology companies and I was use I was investing in things that were around me things that I was using whether it was sand dis with the USB drives I had an Apple phone in 2008 so I bought Apple stock literally at that time Apple was like 30 bucks and the feeling about getting into Venture was I'd love to get closer to these companies before they go public Capital to help them accomplish big things so Venture was a good fit and maybe this is some sort of psychological thing but I love living in uncertainty yeah I don't think that's a trait that many people outside of this industry kind of see but the uncertainty of it doesn't bother me like I that it's very exciting to me and Venture is is all of that and more yeah I want to get to to mat but I want to jump back to one thing that you said because so much resonates with me when you talk about being Venture and you drew a line to your life of not having a lot of money and and wanting to help people like how can you can you connect your like why you picked this area into Venture Capital that I'm able to do now through SRA Ventures is this whole mindset of access and accessibility venture capital is one of the most powerful wealth creation tools this country has ever seen when you think about companies that were Venture back in the stock market and what they've done whether it's Google Microsoft Amazon all these companies were Venture back but historically in this country people like me haven't thought about Venture Capital as a thing that should be included in something that they can invest in nor were the the legal system set up such that regular people could even access it so I think like this they just need visibility and education on it and I know one of the things that I mentioned or I was thinking about in our sort of precursor to this call is why net new investors are important to Surak Ventures for me it's a a huge Testament to look at our LP base and say that roughly 70% of our investors have never invested in Venture Capital before I mean that's a big deal but a lot of that stems from what I did when I was working as a financial adviser going into places in the market where I didn't see other people that were down there talking to people who had means they just needed the visibility of of this particular to build a firm that is supported by people that are excited about this space and they can do it with someone that can talk to them in a manner that's accessible easy to understand transparent and provides them with all the things that everyone else has had access to for decades and to do that in a in a manner that um is also in line with what we're trying to do as a firm with providing access to Capital to Founders that traditionally don't have it so it's like The Best of Both Worlds man you said so much I want to tuck into and you hit like four or five questions that that span our friendship and and uh but before like just a level set for people and I know we didn't want to hear and your your thesis and what you're interested in investing in our thesis is quite simple we are an early stage Venture Capital firm that invests in Founders and geographies that are underserved by mainstream investors my background is in financial services so naturally I look at a lot of we look at a lot of companies in that space fintech sector that maybe it's lending or new Financial products or accounting products think the Paradigm has shifted in how people think about work and technology and security so the future work vertical is really interesting to us as well so thematically that's what we're Affinity with the customers that they're serving meaning that they can intimately relate to the problems because they were those customers and they also have the industry experience to actually build solutions for the problems of people in that in that community in fact one of the deals that we're co-invest on solo funds when you think about the story of those guys y growing up in sort of urban Cincinnati and building Rodney said I mean just to keep it real I I sourced them when I was at the HBCU Founders fund and R was like I think the verbatim was like this is how we loan money in the hood this what like it was straight up and I was just like okay exactly that's what he said and I and these aren't my words this is his in the diligence Callum that that a lot of people don't understand and now they have over two million people using this platform I mean it's insane so those type of things motivate us right the riches and the niches right and and and to find CER now will you do will you do a coastal deal I mean look and I want to talk because you you represent OKC hard um but and I want to talk about uh unseen ecosystems unseen but what you'll do you'll do Coastal deals right you'll do New York Bay Area but that's just do I have that right yeah we have companies uh in La New York Boston some near DC we have one in the South we have a company here so U I live here yeah so why why you know look every time I I think about Oklahoma City I'm like oh you gotta talk to C I mean I think of you like so you rep you rep Oklahoma City hard uh why and what what sort of uh what at first what at first it was it was one of those things where I didn't think about it like being a pro to Sak Ventures that we were here in the middle of the country but now I look at it where investors think about it as such a huge differentiator that we're sort of outside of the group bank and have certain things in order to build amazing companies neither do we as a as a ventured Capital firm so I've really embraced the differentiation there because I've been in all those markets I have networks in all those markets and understand from from a different perspective what I think a lot of managers don't I've been on both sides of the lp GP side and traveled around the world and technology has not only lowered the barrier for people like me building firms but it's also lowered the barrier to bring new types of Founders to the market that just weren't able to before so I think that the like you when it comes to a solo GP there's even know if being a solo GP like we're doing would have been possible 25 years ago at least not like a scalable standpoint no way not with the attch in the ecosystems I mean I think to be honest we have Co to thank better worst a lot for that I don't think it I don't think it would have been at all you know all that being said though like what so so but here you are um tell me tell me about like what are some of the things that make the the solo model worthwhile for you because you youve you're you're ahead of me in terms of the fundraising game um what sort of has been the most rewarding uh and and maybe also most challenging parts of of of going it alone let's talk about the challenging is unlike anything I've ever done before in my entire life you know I've played High School sports I've played division 2 basketball I've done a lot of things that required like a lot of discipline but this is like no other it is a full out grind because I think about a VC firm there are four parts to every firm you have your fundraising which is effectively your sales your marketing which is talking to VCS going to conferences you have your internal operations which is a bunch of other stuff whe whether it's fund Administration or legal and then you have working with Founders and when you're a solo GP you don't have good systems setup or especially in the team we can do that at a high level such that I'm not carrying the burden but in the beginning it can be really difficult all right so anyways we're back a little technical diff difficulty um we were just starting to talk a little bit about um the Journey of being a solo GP and um I think we have a lot of bumps and bruises uh through the way so I'm just curious about what what are some of the tips that you have about um being a solo GP um stuff that you may not tell everyone but just for in our little Enclave of people who are are um nuts like us any thoughts we are nuts uh yeah people who could potentially back the firm and among that list were just individuals that I knew High Network people and just before I was getting ready to go talk to these people I had this idea that instead of trying to raise capital for the fund maybe I should raise some Capital so I can actually get the fund going it's a smaller investment amount it effectively was the organizational expenses that I need in order to get it going and the organizational expenses for a fund can range from usually in an LPA they're like up to $250,000 for larger funds it can be bigger than that but for most emerging LPA that they're going to pay back the those organizational expenses from uh management fees or distributions or whatever it might be and that in that includes the GP commit the GP commit is also a really big one that people have to think about so I was thinking about all different things as opposed to we just need to get investors like well there's a little bit more than that so yeah just to correct myself the fund pays for the organizational expenses the GP commit can be paid back from uh management fee reduction to the GP or through distributions from the fund that come down the line at some point and because I was talking to a lot know who took some money from their retirement dollars and put it toward getting the fund up and going and part of my strategy was taking some of those dollars investing in some companies to show what were going to be some of the companies that the firm would invest invest in when it was up and going so I took a risk and I did that took the first investment was $50,000 into a a company the second one was 25,000 and then the third one was 50,000 in fact the first one was solo funds I put $50,000 into solo funds from my own money to show conviction that hey this is the type of company that I would like to back if we had a bigger pool of into solo funds it's my own money um and that was what I went to Market with my fun zero um now I think you and I are you know we're in the same vintage like we're lucky that we have had some time um to amass some wealth to be able to to to do that because it's not an easy thing to do um but no that was exactly what I did I mean the same thing that fun one is basically just institutionalizing my process that I did as an Angel um on on my own money and my own dime um and um it was hard but it I don't know if it's gonna um uh pan out uh I hope it pans out and I hope that LP do you think LP's like really give you credit for for that here's here's how I know it works I've talked to a lot of emerging managers who their demonstration of their investment thesis to L to potential LPS has been they are effectively paper trading into these companies where they're talking to portfolio companies and they're writing memos and doing all this work but they're not actually giving those companies any money so when an LP sees that they're more like well where's your conviction and conviction doesn't have to be $50,000 to me conviction just has to be a meaningful number where you actually sacrificing something to demonstrate that conviction whether it shouldn't be a VC so I think that it it definitely works even if no one tells you explicitly that it doesn't because it does yeah so I think that that's number one number two you really have to have a strong conviction to take those types of dollar amounts to invest your money into something to demonstrate that this is what I want to be doing for the next 10 years of my life or longer and I'd been doing this long enough to to really feel that way and also what if it does work out and let's say I never do the fund at the very least I have exposure to these companies that I think are going to grow so it's a win-win for me either way so when I went to go ahead started or thinking about starting see if you can find someone that really likes you and provide them with a well put together presentation about what you're trying to build and that's what I did I put together like full pitch deck not just outlining the fund that I was Raising but the firm that I wanted to build yeah and I met with an angel investor who I'd met years ago and I said to him you know I was orig going to talk to you about being an LP in the fund but I really like to talk to you about investing in my man code so I can get some money to get this thing up and going and I shared with him that him and the opportunity even know someone like that do that but that was the launching pad to give me the confidence to literally quit my job and go 100% in this I was going to quit my job or resign from my job anyway but that made it so much easier but it was very strategic to say okay I can get this thing up and going faster if I don't have to worry about that Capital let let me let me get some specifics you dropped a lot of knowledge in there so one you did Angel Investments on your own and sourc them and did the whole thing um and let me go through a laundry list I almost want to make a packing list for solo GPS uh to so you did some sol yeah on your own um you sold the deals how how much Capital how much your Manco and you don't have to get into specifics because like you said everything scales right I I think I think you could execute the same you drop a zero off your check and my check I think if you can show a consistent track record of you know these small check if it's meaningful for you you could do the same thing but like what is your packing list you're like okay I feel like I'm ready or the the packing list where the market tolds you're ready sold little my Manco this did this many deals allocated this much capital in a fund zero can you give me or the listeners soj be's like broad Contours of how to think about what Readiness looks like amongst this and other axes so those three things you mentioned and a financial advisor at Northwestern Mutual they taught you how to sell and one of the things that they made you do before you got hired was go out and assess your network you had to sit down with 10 people and ask that person do you think I'm the type of person that could actually build at my own financial services company and why and part of that was a weeding out process but a lot of it was sort of a a test to see if you could go out there and talk to people about build like your business and there were so many people who couldn't do that not that they didn't have the network they just weren't willing to put themselves out there and do that and I did it was great I did really well in and say hey I'm thinking about doing this would you want to learn about that when I actually launch it and just developed a list of people who I knew I would call on immediately when the thing got up and going makes sense and I think that some people skipped that step and not not sure how many people that needs to be but it is an instrumental part of that journey of discovering how you build visibility and interest in what you're doing so you don't get out there you're starting from day one after you've quit everything you did before yeah man this is a Lean Startup for GPS right and it's so simple right we people get so caught up in Cara and this angelist deal and this Syndicate that like just just test it uh it doesn't require any capital and to be honest with you if you want empathy with with Founders this is what we ask Founders to do right do Lean Startup Capital efficient tests if you can't do that yourself it's going to be a tough may not be cut out to be a VC I was talking to a Founder who she was having some problems with her product and I said well how many how many people have you interviewed and talked to about your product to get a better understanding of how you should build it she was like oh I haven't really talked to many people and I don't know if I don't want to single her out but I do think that we're living in a society where technology has dominated so much that want and then build a pro build a product that meets that particular need or demand not the other way around don't build a solution and then do it after fact so I think that's what most sales organizations when they were like trying weed people out that's what they were trying to get us to figure out is like do you even have the market to do this and that's what I spent a lot of time doing before uh launching Sak but that's what I did before to another firm so you know these are like basic things to me yeah and and I I do think people skip this and and I I can't tell with how many Founders I talk with like they're goingon to prototype I had I had to talk with a Founder this morning about this he's like oh we need more engineering that's the thing I like how many people and it's like oh I haven't talked to them yet I haven't asked for it that's it that this is the problem and I think when we live in a world of AI and where it's easy to produce um I think what you're talking about Rings true and uh is is if you want to succeed in the world of tech and AI I think the goal particularly for where we invest early State it's about finding and being a better human yeah and you got to be your I mean and you got to go first and then go talk to those 10 and then see those commits and then take the six people that said like you are crazy right right you should not do this you you should not do this now as an entreprene right now as an entrepreneur technology to enable you to do that faster it doesn't eliminate the activity or the task of doing that but I've been thinking about AI a lot and how do we as VCS integrate that in our practice for finding L PS or finding Founders or building visibility among other VCS there's all these different things I think it's all about taking all this data and connecting the dots but not elim using it to enhance the human element not eliminate I definitely don't want to lose SI sight of that but I need to get better at that for sure how how can I ask how you're using it today uh I'm not using it today that's what I'm saying I want to use it I want not for lack of desire a lot of it's for lack of time gotcha now I've been using it hardcore for helping writing memos but I you I'll be honest too it's like you know the way ID diligence Founders and their activities that I'll I'll use AI models to help me understand behaviors and and really you know go deep in this psychology and and grit aspect of it and and and and work with unstructured data in ways that would have taken me a long time before and I'm I'm I'm still experimenting I haven't done the deep sea thing since that news broke today or the last two this this past week um but I I do believe I'm like you I I think the goal of AI is to build better humans and and and I I I think now while the the the National investors like you and me where we're really focused on the we're focused on the whole part of making carbon based life forms and then their action better and um I I think we only win when when um there're more competitors minus the Deep State Chinese thing going on um I think it's only going to be stand gain by for investors like you and me either on the investment side or our own fund op side I don't know no I I agree I've been reading about this extensively and a lot of this just came out but I hate to say this and I know that Elon Musk has had a lot of he he's produced a lot of consternation for a lot of people right now but one of the correct and that's just my opinion but when I was working out this morning listening to the news and then subsequently reading about it like I screamed in my head this is what e was talking about that this technology is so powerful that when more people have access to it the better it is for everybody in my opinion it's kind of like the internet why is the internet not free the internet being free opens up Commerce like crazy but we still have to pay for it it's like it doesn't make any sense yeah or it should be significantly reduced so it's more accessibly but it's just things like that so when I was thinking about deep seek and yes it is the right signal hey can I can I go back to something and I've been wanting to talk about um with her with her time I want to talk a little bit about fundraising because you you know you said something to me at culture shift this last year that has stuck with me and and this is why I think you're one of the most intention people out there um so to set this up Kevin and I were at you know um a fundraising event and I was I was all gripped like I had talked to people and Kevin looks at me you look at me like Mike you and I know everyone in this room there's nothing new here for us to do and then and I was just like crap you're right and and you know you started talking about your net new strategy of how you raised your fund uh again without like didn't use this just as a way to like trumpet yourself it it was a very functional way to find asymmetric Capital that I wasn't competing for along with every other GP in the Under the Sun right now can you say a little bit about that strategy about like you and I know everyone here you got to go in the rooms people don't know us um I've stuck with me like like an idea in the back of my mind I can't get it out I think that the events that are marketed are great for visibility but I can't think of one event that I've ever went to where I raised money from an LP from one of them and I don't think there's anything wrong with attending them but I do think that as emerging managers especially solo universally they won't invest in a firm like hours or yours it's just what I've experienced so when I think about net new the idea of creating a new support base takes a lot of cre creativity and grit and part of doing what we're doing as a small firm we have the ability to be a lot nimbler we have the ability to do things a lot faster and make adjustments such that we can enter into these markets and adjust the way our presentation deck looks for someone or adjust what we're speaking or to throw sort of micro events to invite new people to things that uh we're doing that may not have ever had exposure to grease in um some some details and I would love to hear some stories on how you did it and and what's worked for example we did a dinner for doctors we had a few doctors in our in this fun and I was like you know we got like four or five doctors I they know other doctors so I rented a room at a restaurant and had 12 seats and I asked every doctor to bring someone that they know that was fantastic and it's a great event now I'm in communication with these doctors who many of them like I said have never invested Adventure Capital before so we're doing a series of these events to just plant the seed and educate people on the basics and I don't talk about them and say the tvpi and they're like oh I I get that but it's just like so simple when you break it down like that for people who have never thought about the asset class before we also do sort of small micro events around working with other private Market funds that are outside of venture capital to host happy hours like for example there's a firm here in Oklahoma City it's a real estate investment fund we have teamed up together where we go to a Distillery we will invite people from our Network they invite people from their Network and it might be 15 or 20 no it might be like 10 you're like hey it was great connecting let's grab coffee and then when you have coffee that's when you do the connection and explain a little bit more about what you're doing I have picked up investors from that again people who said to me I'm investing in Ventures cuz I thought about venture capital and private markets I just never knew anyone that was doing it so XYZ later they're investing in the fund so it's just think like smaller things like that that we have the opportunity to do and maybe the last point I'll put on this is sort of my theme for 2025 is to grow where I'm planted and the the benefit of that is thinking that have to put in the work to find them and also make what I'm doing easy to understand such that they can get on board and be people who can support me long term so that's sort of my that's been resonating with me like and I'll tell it to the people grow where you're planted and don't worry about all these things that you're seeing in the market because there's so much opportunity right where you are you just have to figure out how to exploit it so okay can you I love that grow where you're planted there's abundance everywhere um can you say more about that because like look the objection is like oh my God these checks aren't going to be big enough uh you know I have a 25 million cover on my fund I don't know what your I I forgot what yours is but 30 million when I when we sort of made this decision to start doing that we were sort of hovering and stuck at a number then when we say all right we're going to double down for the next six months just to test this thesis and then our largest investor is here they put in a $5 million check and a lot of it had to do with just doubling down on what we're doing here spending more time with them different things and for a $30 million fund a $5 million check is a is a really big deal congrats yeah so that reinforced this idea of man we just need to really grow where we're planted but philosophically the extension of that no one is thinking about and it just resonates with me to be like man these guys are growing where they're planted planted and this technology has enabled them to build this amazing business and access customers that uh need what they're doing but if these guys were thinking oh we're in Birmingham we need to start competing for customers in New York and San Francisco and Chicago they probably wouldn't be doing as good as they are so now I look at it as concentric circles both for Founders like them and for firms like ours we need to strengthen and do the best that what we have with where we are and then do fund three and four it's like well for fund one I think that the majority of our support is going to come from around here fund two and so forth it's going to expand but to raise a venture like a scalable firm you kind of have to build build your a solid foundation and then grow from there but I think a lot of emerging managers start to focus on the outer concentric Rings before really building that solid foundation right where they are guilty I mean guilty like and so so count me in that group I I want to I mean like I want to ask about this 5 million dollar anchor without know like but like do they invest because you're going to you we have fer you be in Oklahoma City but if not we you know we're just backing you because of your T how and then how did that ladder with these I mean for me my individual checks you know kind of like the 2500k range I like pick these off one at a time how did you balance both the to use since you played basketball the inside game and the outside game I think a lot of people assume that if you're in Oklahoma or wherever you might be that investors just want to invest around there but I think that part of the benefit of uh talking to investors in smaller markets is they want visibility and exposure to The Best of Both Worlds and fact that we're and here but we're investing in participate in us most investors say man we love the fact that we can get exposure to companies in on the East Coast or here in the middle so that really wasn't that that really has not been an issue with anyone that were investing that hasn't invested with us it's been more of a A plus yeah that's that's great I that's not been my experience like I I I deal with all these Regional Economic Development like like we have all this money if you invest in this ZIP plus 4 region you know something I'm being a little exaggerated but it's like okay well um well one of the things that I said to one of our newest investors and I said this to a bunch of people in Chicago as well when I was talking to them and I don't have any we're going to back managers here that can support Founders here so I'm like okay well if you take the same approach to trying to do something different how do you expect anything to change what makes more sense is to back a manager like me who's looking at your market for a different perspective to identify opportunities that the managers that you want to be there don't see and this just completely changed the perspective of what they were saying because it's almost counterintuitive to say I want to back managers that are in someone like me looking at the market from a different perspective to find those Founders that the managers there don't that aren't investing yet I said this to another state and they were like that's such a good point and then they back us because that mentality just fundamentally does not make any sense yeah I I I again I grew up in Ohio you know so Brown sorry U I've been I've been home um trying to run that same Gambit and I got to tell you I haven't gotten that love with it you know we want in Ohio for Ohio and you know from Ohio I was like I'm from Ohio but and I and I said the same thing it's like I'm I'm from here and I'm not from here I can help br the Gap and I say it's more contrarian and kudos to you to find that there's a guy here that runs a big firm in a private Equity space they do a lot of different types of Investments one of the things that he talked in his investors about was he wants to be located here and he's telling his investors he's like hey if you invest with me I'm going to invest in companies that are outside of this region but one of the things that they do strategically is work with every investment that they've made to do business here to bring their products here to bring their services here to do things here so there's this relationship between them and I just think that it's company can manufactur so when we think about the symbiotic relationship between the two it's kind of like okay you're investing money over here but now they're spending that money here it just makes so much sense so so we just have to I think that just thinking about that stuff differently and having these sort of blunt conversations with LPS whether they invest or not some of them will most of them won't but it does I think take shaking up the industry a little bit to just think a little bit differently yeah I I love that I could I could chop it up with you all day I don't know if you heard my slack going up that's actually a Founder I need to get to so no no there are a couple I I'm going to change some of the lightning round questions on you based on some of lightning rounde one how close have you ever been to getting hit by a bus please disclose and second what's your answer to to that type of objection let's start with the bus let's start with the bus have you been have you been close to getting hit by a bus I've never been close to being hit by a bus but the last time I was in New York I almost got hit by a cab but I don't think that's uncommon I I I'll get that out in edit uh all kidding aside then what's your what's your response to that objection to solo GPS if you even bother to Levy one I think that risk is everywhere but it's about probabilities and most LPA are built and designed to to think about that risk in a in a manner that um doesn't leave LP hung out to drive but term that's unlikely to happen and then in the long term as our firm grows that risk is almost eliminated because I don't expect to be a solo GP for the rest of my career ah so so GP dating you just led to the other one I'm totally changing this on you it's like um you like to give me an idea if you don't have to list the the GP itself but other solo GPS you're interested in dating or or characteristics thereof whenever I was working at the funa funds one of the things I loved about Tomas who used to be at Red Point who started theory was he had this conviction on this thesis that he just went out built it based upon what he was were doing and how the conviction around that was so strong that resonated with me and I knew that whenever I was about to launch this was years years ago that that I would sort of Follow That same sort of sentiment of just sticking to what you're convicted on and not letting anyone tell you anything differently so he did I think he did a really good job of doing that that's how's like a solid GP date and and for those listeners who don't know what this I like um it feels todrey right in the solo GP I I I'm like you I you know we're we're starting together uh starting alone but I I I don't have the same desire to forever but so there's a fair amount of solo GP dating that's going on um I'm sure people in the lp Community know maybe walkup music before a big pitch for an LP or uh or founder what would what would be your walk up I'm a huge fan of Jill Scott one of her favorite songs that it resonates in my mind is a song called Golden and the the the chorus is living my life like it's golden so I think about that all the time how I just feel so fortunate to be able to do this job that the lyrics of that song really resonate with me yeah Jill from Philly that's right I love I love Jill Scott I love the um very cool um well listen you know I I I could talk to you all day and I couldn't have thought of and I I know historical moment right here I guess I guess um you know and like I said you you you were you were invited in my to take a bedroom in the house and you ended up in the virtual living room so I'm glad we did this and you actually got to go home that day but I think it's a good way to bring this all full circle for what we're doing and uh congrats on all your success and we you know I'll see you out there on the road on another cap table another call man love it thank you again for the opportunity all right man cheers be good cheers see you

Oklahoma mik here host back with another episode we are down in the heart of downtown Oklahoma City today giv me a great pleasure to introduce Our Guest Mr to Andre for that and connecting us and then oh he's on the board right I think that's why we had a a table with him the one and only how do you know Andre my sister-in-law went to law school with him okay and we connected years ago lost touch and then recently got back together I'm not even actually sure I think it may have been through positive tomorrows for sure you know what it was through positive tomorrows cuz I've been a donor there for years and someone said oh you should meet Andre he's on the board there and a friend of mine Todd at I forgot his last name he runs a financial investment firm as well he was like oh yeah you should meet Andre I meet him here at uh Bradford house all the time and sure enough ironically Andre walks in the door and I said we were just talking about you so yeah iron freaking athlete and he's going to hate me saying this but I think he had leg surgery last year like a knee surgery or something and he PR his deadlift the day before he went into or the day off he went into surgery because he's like why not I'm going to have surgery anyway might as well just go for it killer I love it um yeah thank you Andre for connecting us appreciate it uh people listening haven't heard Andre's episode he's been on the podcast before I'll link that one below it's a great story um and I made myself like a total fool in that cuz I thought that his Instagram said Coldwell dnasty and it actually says Coldwell Dynasty and my dyslexic brain was like what's the D nasty thing about as on a pug ass you're such an idiot um anyway some people would like that some people would like positive tomorrows over all of the other amazing Charities that we have in Oklahoma City and around the nation I think I said this to Andre it took me a while to to Really reconcile this with myself but that organization is so powerful to me because I literally was one of those kids not that I was in positive tomorrows I grew up in Tulsa Oklahoma but the stories that they have of the struggle the the issues with the parents the insecurity of just life like a lot of my childhood was like that so of course as I'm older um in a different position I want to give back and seeing those kids is like sort of heartwrenching for me because I know what it's like to go through those doesn't mean other organizations aren't but when you see yourself in other people in a real material way you want to do something so that's my small contribution yeah uh take me to Tulsa growing up then what's that like brothers and sisters big small family parents uh married when they were young and it was my brother and myself initially we lived in a normal life you know we went to school every day my mother stayed at home very traditional my father was really conservative and probably around year four or five when I was age four or five they ended up getting divorced and that was the starting point of all these different ironically at the same time you know how these things happens like one bad thing happens and everything else happens after that we lost our house we were homeless for a couple years and sleeping on the floor living in this small little shed in the backyard of a neighbor's house for years and I remember getting up walking to school and sometimes my friends would say hey let's go over to your house and play and I'm like well I don't really have a house but you know those were tough times very something that I think my brother and myself remember vividly and then from there we went into living in like low-income housing and things were just tough so I think that said Hey Kevin you're better than that so I started working hard put my head down went to work in school and started getting straight A all through High School in the 10th grade my high school counselor came to me and he said Kevin I see you're working hard we're getting a lot of inbound scholarships that come to the school and anytime there's one I want you to apply for it so I did and I just applied for so many scholarships sometimes I'd be the only person who applied at all and fortunately thank God I was able to get enough scholarships to pay for like the majority of my college which for me to even go was like such a big deal school and you just kind of looked back and said you know what I'm just so thankful to not be in that situation so when I graduated college uh we moved out of Oklahoma when I say we I met my wife the first year that I had transer referred in to Oklahoma State University and her life was just so different than mine and I admired that her parents had been married like 30 something years and stable home so we just sort of connected not just because of that but for a lot of different reasons but I always tell her like I really admire your family and the values and things like that so we moved out of state lived in Chicago for several years thinking like is this really what I want to do for the rest of my life I had got interested in finance my last year in college started going to the library at night reading books about personal finance investing and thinking oh you can make money doing this and this is what smart people do I grew up relatively poor relative to everyone else I thought I I wanted to change that about my future so thinking through all those different things I went and I said you know what could I do to get into the financial services industry and I started exploring private Equity venture capital investment banking Financial advising and it seemed like the path of lease resistance was to become a financial adviser so I remember thinking how much is the pay and I said well it's 100% commission and she was like well if you don't try then you'll if you it's better to try and to fail than to not try at all so I took that and just ran with it and quit my job after just under two years went to work and started building up a financial services practice mind you I'm in Chicago I don't know anyone up there so I had to just hit the ground like hustling hard working 15 16 hours a day I remember walking around in the streets of Chicago so much that the shoes the leather shoes that I was wearing literally had holes in the bottom of literally in the office sitting at my desk at 5:30 in the morning thinking like why am I doing this and that feeling of oh I don't want to fail I'd lived around failure so much I saw so much fa failure I experienced so much lack that I didn't want my future children to have to go through that so that's what drove me and I felt like I was also making a difference in the lives of other people by introducing them to all these different things that I hadn't really experienced as a as an as a youth and was uh currently experiencing as an adult at that time so first house in Chicago had a great church and things up there and then ultimately my wife decided that uh she wanted to move back to Oklahoma and I was resistant to that for a lot of reasons I felt like Chicago was a new beginning for me as a person and our family and I didn't want to be near any of those different things that being said that doesn't mean I was bitter or angry with anyone I'm not a person who holds on to anger or any sort of resentment toward anyone Life's too short for that so we eventually went back and I had to start over we had to start over didn't know anyone in Oklahoma City I'm exploring venture capital and I thought oh I'm in Oklahoma how am I going to do that there's no Venture Capital industry here mind you this was in 2010 so I had to start over building the network just grinding it out every single day burning through our cash and not knowing how we were going to make it but when you've been through something hard before it's like okay you can do that again I remember when we came back we rented a house or like a duplex in Norman I'm sorry in um Edmund and things were tough but you know it was different like we were someone said I think I saw this in a movie it's like when you're stuck between a rock and a hard place what is the solution well the solution is you just go deeper so my mentality was I'm just going to like keep working hard and from that again place so of rock bottom if you will uh you just you ascend out of it kind of like what we were talking about when I first came in here is like the moments where you feel like you've lost when you're like grinding and hustling you appreciate the win so much more so that's what we did and for the first 2 years we just rebuilt and eventually everything was just on an put in place sort of decades ago and to reap the benefits of of how Oklahoma City is changing everything that we wanted to achieve in life we've been able to do in Oklahoma and including family personal financial starting my own firm and having the experience of working in venture capital and traveling the world I just think it's like a God thing to have the you know feeling like you can do all those different things if you just sort of let go and let things happen so that's where I'm at now you school and you have that moment you hear that voice you mentioned kind of church is is was part of your life as well did it feel like a god voice were you kind of up until that point in church a lot uh you said dad was pretty conservative but sounds like you know your your brother and dad took a different path to what you did and that was kind of a pivotal moment for you where does that voice come from and that awareness at that young age to be like oh no from this this moment I'm going to get straight A I'm going to get my head down because your situation could have gone you know you could it would have been easier of you to go the other way statistically yeah I shouldn't be here but my faith is really important to me I think that everyone is entitled to their own belief people that claim they have no faith like everyone has faith in something so I think that those moments of clarity for me always come in moments of silence and great pressure and and stress so that's usually those sort of Tipping Point moments when I hear that whisper if you will like you're better than that or you should do this or you should do that and a lot of people just have to make the choice on whether or not they want to listen to it so for me listening in the big moments in the right moments you don't always actually do it and that is um I think something that's changed my life I think about this too you know we've as adults we have um experienced loss friends and family over the years and literally just this morning I was writing down uh in my journal about I'm 44 years old in the middle of my life and I know that life is not certain and you start to think about that when you experience loss how do I want to impact the world that to me is really what matters and I access to this space so we're looking to back people from all backgrounds and all geographies across the United States and when I think about my journey I am the last person that someone would have said you'd be running your own Venture Capital firm one day but I think that if you're a person of faith and grit and just raw tenacity you can pretty much do whatever you want to do in this country and I think that being in Oklahoma like and I'm not just saying this cuz this is Oklahoma podcast being in places like Oklahoma where you and I think that uh we were you know we did okay up there but had I been doing that same effort here we would have been way further down the line it's just a different environment I also think that the culture of people is different too where in a larger place places it can be somewhat transactional less Community F whereas Oklahoma City despite its rapid growth still holds on to a lot of that and I'm not sure if that's true for other places in Oklahoma I've only lived in Tulsa and in Oklahoma City but I think it's just about sort of the culture I forgot what your question was but um no you the other thing I I kind of and I agree with you the community growth mindset here but it's it's a we growth mindset right not an ie and me growth mindset um which is you know makes great for fostering business relationships and Partnerships and general growth going back to you being getting the scholarships applying for scholarships what's the what's the reason that you choose to go into mechanical engineering when you're a kid I thought it would be the best way to satisfy my curiosity okay I was always curious about how things worked I think I had that being the benefit of like the younger child sitting back and just watching what was happening before me and whether that was like something experiential like with a things that I saw not being done correctly so that extended into wanting to be creative like I was a phenomenal artist when I was a kid I always say all the way up through college and I thought art was a great exper expression of things in your mind I've always been fascinated with bringing things out of your mind and making them material I think it's one of the unique things that we have and possess as human beings is our ability to be creative so art was a way of doing that and I thought oh I like drawing maybe I should be an architect and then architecture came into well how do they actually make these amazing things and that led to as a kid when you grow up with out a lot of things you have to figure out how to do stuff whether that's feed yourself or make something work that you need that's broken you just kind of have to figure that out you learn how to be resourceful when you don't have a a lot of stuff which carries over into well it's what Engineers do so I did that and it was a great short career but has been beneficial in so many different ways in every single thing that I've done you're pretty good at math and art then right it's problem solving generally what leads you to pick up a pencil when you're a kid drawing artwork and and I mean what style and and fascination with could whether it was print or cursive I still have very good penmanship and that was sort of the beginning I take I think that and I always tell this to younger people the product that you produce will be consumed by somebody and how do you want to represent yourself like if someone were to pick up something that I wrote and like oh Kevin Moore wrote that that leave behind or whatever he wrote is an expression of who you are and if your penmanship is sloppy and you don't care to me that's a translation of well is that the type of person that that that want to make progress towards something big you have to believe in doing a little bit of that thing every single day consistently so managing those little details are so important to me and if I'm like that then the way that I write should be a translation of that belief so if every single stroke of my pen or pencil is is an expression of something I believe then of course my pmip is going to look good so you know I taught myself how to speak Spanish I've never lived in a Spanish speaking country but it's always been a goal of mine to learn another language so when I graduated it I guess four things and I did that every day it's like well how much time are you taking like 5 minutes then that five turned into 10 then the 15 then to so on and so forth and then 11 years later you can speak fluent Spanish and obviously I've traveled and done a lot of things in between them but there's no secret just like there's no secret to success there's no secret to it you just have to do the little things every single day all the time I think that life is just like that but I attribute it to the incremental little things that you do make up who you are and where you are in life maybe but just like preaching lessons of life and he said you you he said every one of you has to remember that you and only you are responsible for the outcome of your life like no one else can control the outcome like every sing single decision you make is your decision and the accumulation of those decisions create who you are and where you will be in your station in life I still remember that to this day that was literally over 25 years ago over 25 years you know your you know we're coming to the end of the year there New Year's resolutions it's that time to reflect and and you're right if you just literally 5 minutes 10 minutes every single day we all want to do everyone you know probably says I want to do a different language right or I want to do yoga or I want to be more flexible I want to do this that like it's that simple it's so simple I had this I have this goal that I'm working on right now yeah is I want to be able to do 200 push-ups in just one go so I said how am I going to do that it's a pretty big go right yeah but guess how it started so months ago yeah I said I'm going to start doing five sets of different types of like now do those in a row say Okay each week I'm going to add one to each set so then the next week instead of doing five for five do six for five so now I went from 25 to 30 so I've been doing that for months now I'm every night doing 10 and what was it 29 * 3 so I'm doing 145 push-ups every day yeah every every day yeah and then on Sunday I change it to go up one okay so next week I'll be at 150 so every week you had one every week it's the exponential effect of that you see what I'm saying so then now when I do 150 it's like no big deal but it would have been months ago is that your only workout every day as well no that's just my night routin that's your R that's just my night routine love it that's but you're what literally start with five right five every day or five of each one every day 25 push-ups a day for a week and then you've just gone up incrementally once add one yeah so then 30 weeks in right and so you'll get to your goal when you're what 40 something weeks yeah right 48 pretty simple yeah 45 May something like that but that's how everything starts I said to myself I wanted to start working out every single our trainers said in order to be successful you have to prepare your environment for success and that that sort of rang true for me in that if you prepare your environment to succeed you have a higher probability of actually succeeding so every night before I go to sleep I set out my workout clothes I know exactly what I'm doing so in my sort of sleepy Slumber and and stumbling to the closet I don't even have it's just like a routine I just put on this and put on that and go do that like I don't even have to think about it so if you eliminate all those distractions then you can do these things like every night my yoga mat is right there by the bed think that you have to do these really big things to do something amazing it's just a compilation of small things every day yeah what are the other goals you're working on at the moment so that's one uh sort of personal is I guess let me talk about Fitness more on that it's get to 200 yeah I want to be able to from a stretching standpoint put my head to my knees I'm getting close a little bit every day so I do that every day um now like Financial not really worried about that stuff cuz you know what is that it's all relative to next generation of venture capital firm here in Oklahoma and to me what that looks like is one that is super inclusive has a diverse leadership team is one that is demystifying venture capital and has a very Hands-On approach to working with with companies I knew that in order to to do what I'm doing I said it's going to take 5 years of my life of just straight up grinding it out sacrifice not just for me but for my family as well and that's a big goal for me is getting Sak Ventures to a point factually it is the least diverse by ethnicity and gender industry I would say in the world less than 1% of venture capitalists are black people like myself less than 1% I'm not and that's in the US it may be even worse in other places less than 1% of the Venture Capital dollars that are raised every single year go to women and people of color that doesn't mean that there aren't other good companies out there but it's not representative proportionately MH so if we can say one we want to invest in everybody so what they do better so if we can deliver to our investors this idea that not only are we choosing amazing companies that have the opportunity for hyper growth but we're doing so in a manner that uh increas is the opportunity for everyone that's out in the market maybe the last thing I'll say about that is one of the things I learned early in my career is that you find the highest quality product or service or whatever when you have a full view on what all the opportunities actually are so if you don't see all of the opportunities in the market how do you know you're product if you will that's a big goal it's one that motivates and moves me to get up at 4:30 every single day and do this as hard as we're going yeah how I think I already know the answer to this and I think you kind of might have already answered it as well but curious to because it's something I struggle with you know what you said and based on your situation growing up you know there was a level of comfort that you got to right and and there was a level that you know you proved a lot of people wrong by getting to you know mechanical engineer got a good job you know and you have this itch to be like hang on finance those social things that you goals that you get to there comes a point where you get and you're just like why get up at 4:30 I'm like this is good enough yeah like what is in you in your own words I guess that keeps you going and fights that Comfort because I don't I think people probably listening struggle with it too right they just they get to a certain State you know thing they let their health go a little bit they've got some money in the bank now they bought the car that they want to drive like you know they're now they're not continuing to do those five minute things every day to continue they might learn a different language or to push themselves to keep going they get lazy and might get fat and whatever it is like everyone seems to do that at a certain point in their career doesn't that I'm not better than anyone no one's better than anybody at all right but one of the questions I've always wanted to know is what are my limits and I think when you live with this sort of the conditioning of lack and wanting to maybe do better question you ask yourself is like well what is better like am I doing the best that I can do and so when I ask myself that every single day it's like am I giving this my best is this the best I can write if you was like feeling amazing and I said you know I've never tested how far I could run just straight up and I said I wonder how far I could run if I just like kept going until I just absolutely passed out and I you know there's a lot of people who do that and if you've read books about people like is it David Goggins or groggin whatever like he's like running a 100 mile marathons in the desert no what whatever but he was just like man I could do more but I think there's this fundamental question that everybody should ask thems is like what is your absolute limit and the reality is as eat is there a limit to that how far can I run how much better of a person can I whatever whatever it is how many push-ups can I do if I get to 200 I'm like well can I do 201 one I saw a competition of this guy on YouTube literally I think he did a thousand push-ups in a row his his arms became so functional like our legs like we could go walk for hours and not even feel it in our legs like we wouldn't even think about it you probably go to wherever you're you're from the UK you can go walk around your hometown for hours and not even be like oh you know you're not going to be like I need to rest my legs I'm on this kick maybe midlife crisis CR kick of what are my limits and I don't think I've reached them yet yeah it's I've done a few you know when you turn 30 you do a few things right you start running you start playing golf or whatever you know we all know the cliche things like got into a little bit of running late 20s early 30s and did some kind of races that you know there's a great race shout out to the Midsouth gravel race in in Still Water um there's a on the Friday there's a 50 km run and then on the Saturday the real people show up and ride 100 mile bike right some people do both those guys are crazy um but I've done the run I haven't done the bike yet I've done the run and and you know you're yeah it's 31 Mi 50 km yeah I crossed the finish line and I'm like I need to sit down right like I'm broke and you know the guy who was at the finish line that kind of watched me finish said to me you know I'm sat in the curb and just kind of like you know panting and can't feel my knees he you see that lady over there and I said yeah some like you know 50-year-old lady or whatever he goes she finished 30 minutes ago you got to point that I appreciate it but you you have to you have to test your limits right like my limit at that time was 525 I'm hoping to do it's in March um and I'm hoping to do it in sub five this year like I'm going to try and keep going but there's so many unanswered questions and we just don't you know okay most people relat to Fitness right what are our limits in Fitness cuz it's easier I think to find our limits in Fitness right um but you but you know like our kids like the Next Generation my wife and our kids if with the same work that I have now I had their situation oh my gosh right I mean come on I'm working within the limitations and the constructs of the limits that were around me yeah and thank God first and to America and to the country and Oklahoma and all these different opportunities that I've been able to do what I'm do here but I'm like I'm I'm I'm trying to do the best with what I have see you also you spent 30 plus years building a foundation so that you can really then use those foundations to Del frog the kids growing up now now they already have that and one thing my father did say to me that resonates to this day is do the best with what you have and don't complain don't act like anyone owes you anything just don't complain shut your mouth and do your work work I remember the story it's quite an uninteresting one but I was in the kitchen as a kid washing dishes and I ran out of dish soap and my dad said well just get some laundry detergent and I said I don't think that's going to work so he brought it over and he did it and I'm washing the dishes with laundry detergent the powder kind and if you've ever done that it makes the dishes like extremely slippery almost to the point where you can't hold them like sliding out of my like if someone I put that on my tombstones do the best of what you have so we all have our constructs of how we grew up and some people like my kids have this amazing opportunity and and so do most kids so that's why I'm like don't complain just do the best yeah where you mentioned ear there's always been a dream for you to launch kind of your own company your own business let's talk about that when did that launch where did the idea come for for for you the inclusion and everything and the opportunity you see and then also where do you find the name for it as well where does that come from I was working in venture capital around the world of saying that man there's just not a lot of people who look like me in this business and deciding then that I wanted to try to build something so I said okay great that was step one step two was sort of coming up with the idea and at my last job we were in San Francisco giving a presentation to our investors about the portfolio and I equated the idea of building a company like climbing a mountain and if you look at Mount Everest there are zones in order to get to the top and the higher zones are more dangerous they require documentary around climbing mountains which I do all the time cuz I I love that and my wife will never permit me to climb like Mount Everest I would like least like to go there that to that point that 14 Peak is it 14 Peak yeah that 14 Peaks phenomenal documentary how in the world did the I mean go watch it people it's amazing please yeah so yeah I've watched all of those but I I was watching one and they were talking about uh K2 and K2 the narrator was like oh these there's a massive Sak on the top of K2 and these climbers have to get through there and yada Y and it just clicked in my head it's like oh this Sak is an enormous obstacle and when you Ventures would be a good name for the firm because we all have Saks that we have to overcome in our life I've had them personally professionally everybody has had them what better name to name a firm to say we help Founders overcome the Saks or the obstacles that they face when they're trying to navigate this industry or trying to raise money for their business or trying to overcome operational issues so Sak Ventures is great so I as the name and then someone said to me hey did you know that sarak spelled backwards is cares and I said I had no idea then I looked at it I'm like oh it does say cares I mean we do care I think that's a bit corny and cheesy reading Finance in the library and reading all those books did you think at that moment I want to be in a finance I want to have a financial company was that a moment or was it I mean later on you're just like I want to know Finance because I've never been taught this and it's not something I it was the latter it was more so I just wanted to teach myself how to do this but no I I never thought I always thought at some point I might run my own company but I didn't start Sak Ventures because I want to run my own company solely it was more I wanted to be a part of building something and never thought that it would be Finance I mean it could have just been a a regular company if it hadn't worked out that way I just think that have a seat at the table to control where it's going venture capital is like the Phenom like the best path for making that happen and I love my work I'm so lucky to get to do this job and I wouldn't trade it for the world yeah when did this company stop January of 23 okay took the first quarter some of Q2 of 23 to just get the infrastructure started and then started talking about the story and building a name for the firm and made a couple hires some part-time some fulltime we had our first close as a fund which when fund and we won't cut off our fundraising until sometime late next year but that's sort of the idea when you're investing in private markets you are taking money from private investors pulling it together and then pushing it out to different companies yeah with um do you still read quite a lot today every day okay I have a goal to well not a goal it's just from 5 to 530 every day I read okay something I try to read two books a month a lot of that depends on the the thickness of the book yeah but I've I'm weird and letters exactly okay one letter at a time okay so that's how I think about reading it's like oh you know if I read sometimes I calculate I have 15 days I read this book how many pages I have to read per day and you just do that yeah what are you reading right now I'm reading this book called the 100-year marathon it's about the interplay between China and US struggles okay and um phenomenal book I recommend people read it because it really accurately describes the relationship between the US and China and how they've sort of we and when I say we my friends and I we talk about how people need to read more to understand a lot of the history behind some of these things so that's one book I'm reading the book I just finished was a book called the reverse Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell it's sort of a continuation of his first book which basically talks about tipping points but in this case these are tipping points that are actually bad and why did those happen yeah quite frankly it wasn't as good as his last book but I still read it but I'd like to read a lot do you do any guess speaking I've only been on podcasts but you just 100% transparency with you and your audience it it it took starting Sak Ventures for me to become this transparent because even though I have a track record as an investor Sak Ventures is a new firm so people are investing in me mainly so opening up about my why is really was really hard for me no one I mean look it's embarrassing to talk about how I grew up or used to be it's embarrassing like oh your dad was in prison a number of times or you were poor and you did this and really motivating so then prayerfully and just thinking through it if I don't share that story with people then so many other people won't know and be motivated to overcome their obstacles cuz I think there are a lot of kids who just don't have hope and once you lose hope it's over yeah to that point I listened to a podcast recently talking about um just exactly that really we don't share our stories as much right and it was in the sense of like the older generation doesn't share their stories so when Grandma granddad's uncles aunts are gone like you don't those stories go with them right no one's documenting these stories and so that's that's kind of the the next arm to this is Oklahoma is you know there's only so much I can do for the podcast and I yeah I would love to do this every day and post daily episodes but the there is you know when look back at my own life right my own grandparents and my parents like you know thankfully I still have time with my parents with my grandparents I interviewed my granddad I didn't interview my grandmother or my grand um but I interviewed my granddad and it's the greatest thing I've done I think for the family like you know cuz we have that right but you know it's so easy to do with an iPhone just set up right but it's people to your to your point have to you you had to get over that you had to cuz cuz like you said you know and that's you know everybody has a story head down grind you know put food on the table like they weren't thinking I have a podcast I have this like it's on their radar yeah we live in this Society now where there's like this people Embrace more openness but it might be because it's so much much easier to reach people so people don't really show the authentic side of themselves cuz they like oh why do I need to do that I can move on to the next thing so for me it was and you know I still feel not like super comfortable doing it but I've gotten it's easier to do to realize our stories are about who make us who we are they make us who we are and we shouldn't be ashamed of it we should just embrace um 20 there's there's a great guest on the podcast and a guy named Colonel Stanley Evans who plans his life in 20 years St and he's like who am I going to be in 20 years right kind of like what you do you break it down daily you know the whole eatting an one by at a time but it's great to when most people do the three to 5 year thing and the 10 year thing but when you look at 20 years you know you're going to be 64 years old and 20 years looking back as a 64y old what are the things that you want your 64 year old to be proud of and tell you I want people to remember me as a very generous person and that means that"

        "full_transcript": "someone who I've known for some time now and Kevin Moore welcome to the podcast thank you for having me good morning Kevin it's great to have you on um you are now the managing partner and founder at sarak ventures and we are going to dive into all things Sak in this podcast but I really want to jump right in um your background is very interesting you've been in the world of financial services Northwestern Mutual Morgan Stanley the Federal Reserve then you were uh an LP a limited partner um for sometime and now you switched over to the GP the general partner side of things with running sarak I would just Venture Capital industry in general is just the versatility and nonlinearity of their backgrounds and I feel like in Venture Capital having multiple experiences allows you to relate and and understand path of so many different entrepreneurs yeah I guess one missing piece before becoming an LP I worked at a firm called i2e where I was investing in startups and it was there where I was Raising capital for one of our funds and called on a fund of funds and didn't realize that this organization was within our state Oklahoma and I went to work there as a partner and that transition of going an investor you should be able to think about investing as a framework and apply that to whatever medium so working on the lp side was enlightening I will tell you that it is something that I think a lot of GPS have not had the experience or chance to do and it's certainly been one that has been additive to the role that I'm in now sort of back in on the GP side and especially in the managing Partners seat so happy to go in any direction there but uh we could dig really deep into this but I want to make sure that that's just sort of the overall benefit I've got from seeing both sides of the table you're right there is a lot of overall benefit there and we will know were thinking about starting sarak how did you go about crafting this thesis to fit within the ecosystem what did you see missing in the capital stack and and how did you think about SX differentiation you know all the things you you go through mentally when starting a fund I will say to be honest in hindsight 2023 was the worst time start a venture capital fund obviously I didn't know that at the time uh the idea of starting a firm started around three or four years ago it always been something I'd always wanted to do since graduating college but filling in the to see there was an opportunity to say one there's not enough representation in the Venture Capital industry for people who look like me as a person of color and then two there were some amazing emerging large categories in the market where amazing Founders were building great Technologies such as in the future of work category the Creator economy category and obviously with companies that are sort of expanding access to financial services so when I started to think about that in regard to a fund uh 2023 was really a year of refining that and then bring I brought on another individual to the team Daryl freder and we were sort of talking about the categories where we were investing and services that increase and make the lives of individuals and businesses easier more efficient and just overall better and the companies that we've back so far enable that but that's the thesis of the firm going forward and obviously that might change over time but really the whole thesis is expansion of the access to services for the masses and not looking at Venture this narrow gap of it only helps a certain type of person and and can only go into certain types of markets so we have that versatility at SRA Ventures future of work expansion and or platforms now that are popping up allowing consumers to invest um in alternative asset classes like wine or real estate or whatever it may be um when you think about the traditional kind of stock market and how people are were in that during the pandemic and now they're transitioning into to unique things gold um stocks or whatever it may be so as you kind of think about that what you know what what part of the capital stack relative to venture are you focused on is it seed is it preed series a any geography bounds um tell us more about that Peter Wagner at Wing Adventures less at earlier stages in their life cycle and when he compared series a stage companies 10 years ago they were at the same valuation and had made the same type of progress as a seed Stage Company today and that really reinforced Sak's thesis to say hey you know what we can come in at the seed stage add a lot of value get respectable valuations and not have like these crazy enormous uh ground sizes and still be able to make an impact because these companies have progressed so much further along by way of what they can do with technology their ability to work virtually and have so so much faster so that sort of uh galvanized okay seed and then even now looking at preceeds companies that have made significant progress to where now you can look at it like a late preed Stage Company is one where they're at the brink of being a seed Stage Company but it's might they might be classified as preed just because of their round size or because of their valuation but it it says nothing to the fundamentals of the company one of the things that I like to look at in a company is their Pipeline and where they're going and getting into a company early you can get a sense for how they're doing that how they're taking how they're going to Market who their potential customers are which is something that we try to do is valuation round siiz pipeline that we look at to determine okay this is the company that we want to back uh if it's beyond that and it's a series a or series b or later generally the round sizes are too big for us but the seed late preed stages are where I think we can be the most effective and add the most value I agree with that and you mentioned right I think preed seed pretty much have a different definition depending on what region of the country and world that you're in as well certainly a preed in the bay may be different from a preed in Oklahoma or Atlanta or Miami um and you're right be let's say 10 15 20 years ago and I think that's definitely attributed to this paradigm shift that you mentioned also this platform shift of now having AI at the table to build applications and and do the role of you know several team members with a team of three and so I'm curious to hear you know at sarak you and Daryl and the broader team how are you all thinking about AI in terms of specific verticals that you're interested in whether it be along the future of work or unique ways that you want to or are thinking about deploying AI internally at Sak I love AI I love technology when it around investing for the last 18 years not and again that's not all in the private markets eight years of that was in the public markets but what I think about is not so much the technology but I think about the utility and to me utility is so much more important than anything regarding technology and I've seen of several companies over the years and even other sectors over the years that have fallen because people were so en enamored with the technology that they weren't thinking about okay what's the practical application and is this actually going to help us make money I think the last government some to some extremes I think that the ideology of that is great but the practical application never never materialized I think AI is a little bit different in that it's a phenomenal uh technology that applied to so many different sectors can make things more efficient there's obviously a fear of AI coming in and destroying the current sort of uh employment infrastructure that we have today but you know other technology Cycles have occurred like this over time AI is just another one um so I don't dislike AI I love it we think about it it it helps a lot of things that we do at Sak Ventures by way of collecting access to Capital better products and better Services that's the question that it has to answer regardless of what the te underlying technology is yeah you know we hear I know I hear dozens of pitches I know you hear a lot of pitches as well companies will say there's there's AI in their product you you kind of get under the hood you you do a demo you use the product and you see there's really not how are you from a high level dilen in AI opportunities that come across your table often times these deals are are pretty hot you know they're moving quickly um at least there's a lot of fomo created around the opportunity from the founder perspective but how do you technologist and in order to fill that Gap there's a couple of people on the team that I trust who really know that space Ryland Donaldson and one of Sak's Guild members or advisers Garland Moore whenever I'm looking at a technology and the application layer if I can't understand it and it's going sort of the toward the Deep Tech sector I always bring in these experts to help me understand hey is this actually doing what it says on the back end and to the point where I have to do that that's when I start to feel like oh this is a company that's actually building the tools like the internal wiring behind to me the difficulty in scaling that is you're now marketing a product which takes a lot of spend and you're not essentially building a tool that can be used for multiple types of other companies doing the same thing that they're trying to do with uh marketing so that's the thing we're looking for if we're looking at AI the most attractive opportunities are ones that are building the pics and shovels the tools that are fueling the companies that are actually utilizing Ai and those are I think harder to understand hence the reason why bringing outside experts to help validate those decision-making from investing in funds to saying hey this is a red flag I should double check with the general partner or the specific Venture Capital firm or whatever asset it was at this time about this or I should ask them these questions what decision Frameworks carried over from the lp side to now how you think about decision making as a as a GP yeah I really like this question because I think about again as I mentioned investing in general through the lens of Frameworks and if you're an LP and looking at a GP or even if you're a GP looking at a company you still have to ask these following Universal questions one at the these types of companies in these sectors so it's really just that high level question the second one is how does it add to the portfolio it needs to be additive can't be something that's going to be less impressive or add less potential upside as companies or funds in your existing portfolio the second one is what is our process or the third one is what is our process of due diligence and are we sticking to that uh when I was in LP we had a system of things that boxes that we checked and we went through that like religiously we do the same exact thing as VCS we have internal Frameworks and we have checkboxes of things that we must gather things that we must know in order to probably the most important is how do we monitor the investment monitor the investment going forward are we having regular quarterly check-ins are we meeting with individuals at their annual meeting are how of how are we collecting information to keep up up excuse me keep up to date with what happening with those companies so that's essentially the process so I I look at it like there the process is no different as a GP as an LP or even if you're investing in the public markets it's like if you can answer those five questions and develop a process for how you're doing things to me your process is what leads to long-term performance versus just getting lucky on something because you makes sense and something goes wrong you can't be upset that it went wrong you should be upset if you look back and you didn't follow your process and that to me is has made a huge difference in how I think about investing is that that structure of process Kevin I really appreciate this perspective because you know there's there's a couple of podcasts that are out there doing a really good job of kind of demystifying how LPS think about Investments I know swimming with allocators by Ernest s um is a really good one Samir Kaji has a really good one called Venture unlocked but uh another question on this tangent for you fund two any Frameworks that you can provide for us around around that Insight I think people who have developed strong conviction around emerging managers are those who've had success investing in them and I'll say this with a grain of salt many of the most SU successful funds that are in the market that have been around and sort of brand names many of them sold or they might continue to sell on the success of their funds one two and three and there are characteristics to those funds that make them more successful and again this is my opinion but to a certain degree it's an educated and it was a one fun strategy it was like we're going to focus on early stage now as those funds get more successful they have a preed early stage a growth and in some cases they might even have a fund where they're purchasing public so then they're doing all these different things and they become these massive institutions so when I think about just the evolution of uh you know how funds evolve and why people like these earlier smaller funds it's usually they like that sort of narrow focus and concentrated strategy and LPS today especially with the pool of emerging managers that are coming out are looking for sort that next Founders fund or that next Sequoia capital or that next organization and that's the hope that you're looking for you know I I actually been thinking about this question a lot especially in the last two or three years but I've just been so many emerging managers come to Market and the difficulty that LP's fac with making the decision of is this the right one that I'm going to back I think that it's a it's a great opportunity because there just such a wide set of opportunities to choose from but unless you can have that framework of what you're looking for and I think that LPS who have done it before are going to be the ones to benefit because they've seen kind of how that system works and how they can actually be profitable there yeah that's really interesting and hopefully that will couple of fund managers that we have gotten spec a specific and direct feedback from on how they enjoy the podcast so appreciate that Insight Kevin and as we wrap up this conversation right sarak is is a young firm that has made some really exting Investments early on maybe you can walk us through you know a couple of those deals that you all have done already and and why you had conviction in the team or or opportunity in in Tam as well yeah absolutely you know again just going back to just to frame that question you know the general thesis at Sak is that entrepreneurship entrepreneurship is the future of work and for the last several and I think there's obviously some examples like Google where they reward people for spending their free time or they give them time to just create and come up with new ideas and I think also one of the other things what that reinforces is that our society is moving toward this entrepreneurial mindset where companies expect their employees to create and they're rewarded for that so one of the things that that has yielded is this whole thing about the Creator economy and people creating content that is consumed in a completely different way than it used to 10 years ago most people are consuming on their mobile and at home and one of the companies that we content they're they're creating online and they've teamed up with MasterCard to help those creators obtain Capital that they need to grow their business and this company has had explosive growth in fact they just sent me their last numbers they more than quadrupled their year-over-year revenue from 23 to from 22 because of this surge of craters that are out there and that entire Market by 2026 is suspected to be half a trillion dollars in Market size and it continues to grow but it's just another example of a great company that's not only expanding access to Capital but it's to borrow and lend one to another in small dollar increments most of the time if people need small dollar loans it's very difficult to get that from a traditional bank so they've set up and designed a payback mechanism and a and catering to these types of borrowers such that they can get the money they need for small things so they don't end up into credit traps and ruining their financial history in the long term so companies like these that were really excited about that fit those themes thematically and we'll continue to look for those going forward yep I love it I love it yeah those are two interesting companies I know you have a few more that we've talked about as well but you Oklahoma and and what advantage do you have of being kind of centrally located in the country when it comes to to to deal flow well I started the firm here and I'm originally from OK from Tulsa originally and moved out of state lived in Chicago then we moved back to Oklahoma City which is where my wife is from and all the things I didn't Venture as a GP as an LP we're all here I think that one of the benefit of working in a small but fast growing economy like OKC is really the support you have from your peers and Business Leaders to succeed especially when you're building a company like a BC firm that has the potential to back transformative middle of the country makes it so much easier to get to all of those places which expands our access to entrepreneurs all over the country you know we don't have an Oklahoma Centric Focus but the ease of transport to all these amazing markets including the one that we're in just enhances the overall portfolio overall but I will say that Founders in I wouldn't call them overlooked parts of the country but growing parts of the country they're very Scrappy and they have thrived for a very long time doing more with less I can name a bunch of examples of companies that have had coming to the shore I think the waves that are near the shore are great but the ones that you want to ride kind of surfer analogy are the one are the big ones coming that you can't see but you know are developing and that's how I think about smaller markets around the country great Insight Kevin this has been a really fascinating uh deep dive on on how you think about life as an LP how PS make decisions and and funds and and fund managers and then also how you think about sarak and your thesis unfolding and developing through the real dollars being put to work so how can a Founder who's listening to this conversation get in touch with you is there a form on your website or or anything like that there is a form on reach me on LinkedIn Kevin Joseph Moore I'm out there awesome Kevin really appreciate your time today thank you for joining no thank you"

relationship yeah these companies that we invest in will be invested in them for probably more than seven or eight years so we have to be able to do more than that not only that we want to stay relevant for more than that time frame welcome to the golden group strategic growth podcast featuring expert insights interviews with thought leaders in business plan triage hosted by Kyle Golding award-winning entrepreneur CEO and chief strategic idealist for the golden group hello everyone and welcome back to the Strategic growth podcast I'm your in his background don't let those youthful looks fool you he extensive background and experience in business that we're going to glean from today so welcome to the podcast Kevin thank you for having me quickly just give the folks I mentioned that you're you're the founder sarak but give give people the two minute version of of your your background and what you've been doing leading up to your role at SRA I have a very non-traditional path into venture capital I started as an engineer I worked for for a financial I was a financial adviser for six years then I worked for the Federal Reserve Bank then I worked on the GP side of venture investing in companies and I've also worked on the lp side of the industry take on business finance and the startup culture Etc that's happening right now in 2024 yeah I used to think that getting into venture capital or any industry really it was a linear path you go to school you do this you do that well that's not the case in fact I was talking to someone ear today around every single experience that I've had and every single experience that people have if they have an end goal they should try to get as much from each experience because it's going to help them when they get to that ultimate objective actually my my story is not too dissimilar I spent 15 years in the music industry before I got into marketing as a creative and then more on the business development Economic Development aside the last 15 years or great operating background with big tech companies and he said when he was leading these companies he would always tell people hey there's the mountain in the distance that's where we're going and we may not know exactly how we're going to get there but always keep that in mind that's where we're going and that's how I think about that's how I've thought my career especially when younger people ask me what do I need to do to do X Y or Z like set a long-term goal and everything that you do in between is going to help you get there and that's really kind of a snapshot too of how business works too right uh someone has an idea for a business and they go through the process of developing a business plan and structure financing it whether they do it internally or have external Partners get prepared for things to not go exactly how you want them to go and my mentality is things either go better than what I planned or sometimes worse than I plan but I never expect things to go exactly how I planned but also say that we should plan right we should have a framework for how we're going to get to a place and then with every single thing that happens you can adjust that framework but keeps moving forward yeah so as a GP now with sck how do you see the the the industry as over overall business in Oklahoma and the influence how do you feel where we're at and where do you think we're going from 2025 on if we continue at the same pace of expansion of adding more Venture Capital firms in Oklahoma then we're on a exponential growth path when I moved to Oklahoma City after living in Chicago and moving back to the State there were no Venture Capital firms other than i2e right and maybe some others that sort of fizzled out maybe there's a life science firm that that wish you life science or that one I think uh William Piva was running oh right that firm I forgot the name of it but now when you look today across the landscape there's a number of VC firms in Oklahoma City in was like a first time ever in 14 years since I've been here where that's happened and that happened this year so I think that it's an it's an it's a industry in in nationally but to see that happening in Oklahoma city is a really good thing but I also think that it's indicative of the influence and spread of venture capital across the country such that entrepreneurship is so much more accessible because of Technology because of virtual work because of Transportation I mean even with our airport we can fly to New York to LA to Chicago to Miami direct we weren't able to do that before so having that accessibility and now the the transportability to be able to do these someplace where they couldn't get to within two or three hours by plane right but now that Oklahoma's on the map and a lot of other similar size cities are on the map all that's changing right plus of course our proximity to to Dallas Austin Kanas City like the middle of country obviously as capable as as the coast as well right yeah absolutely but we also have a little bit different attitude here I feel like uh whether it's just running a business or working business and Venture Capital Partnerships a different sort of outlook on how to be successful in the midwest than kind of East Coast sort of you know portfolio building and looking for unicorns sure do do you see it the same with a smaller team with less money maybe they have some customers uh I think the downside is when it comes to getting that later stage Capital to invest in their business one you have to think about customers outside of your local and then two you have to think about who's going to finance your growth grow that's one of the things I've always been a proponent of is as our ecosystem grows and our companies start to show traction one the early stage investors like me and others can get them to that first meaningful inflection point but you're going to need the larger investors that can invest five or 20 million into these companies to really help them really to grow like the next paycom you have to be willing to accept capital from from other places right now you mentioned that your focus is early stage so for those anyone listening who doesn't quite understand what that means kind of explain early stage investing generally when a company is getting going they are bucketed into this part of the the sort of economic cycle of hey you're just getting going you're you have some paying customers and you have a small team but if there's a significant variation in the market with the economy or something or your customer based changes you're still at risk of like know the management team is not making much money most of what they have is in equity and they're getting to a point to where they're trying to create some sort of intrinsic value which for them is a a good customer base and having achieved uh the elements of what is the product Market fit so so that's the early stage this is where we invested and our idea as Venture capitalists is to invest in enough of these companies such that at the end of our 10-year fund four or five of them have amazing outcomes because the other 20 might uh fall fall to these issues that happen to these early stage companies so that's the early stage so the the the growth stage or the series stage or where later stage investors come in the door is helping them to form a a formal board to scale their operations to open up offices around the country all those that expansion build out the sea Suite you're not doing that when you're at the early stage and then ultim then beyond there it's just more and more of that until you have an exit and of course there's Angel and startup that's even earlier than that but that that's not a space that you guys actively participate in no we so Angel and like the startup and the friends and family rounds those are absolutely critical stages of the business but typically those stages occur or can occur when there's like zero are hard to control yeah and you know those risks are uh ones where the people investing you are really banking on who the founder is right and that's okay I I think that this type of in industry is based upon risk when people invest in Venture Capital they're looking for beta because they have Alpha somewhere else whether that's in the stock market whether it's in real estate more stable assets maybe they own their own business so I think they're okay with that no entrepreneur should ever feel bad about losing air quote someone's money if their business doesn't work out the investors already know that it may not so take the risk of course we're assuming that they have put the extra in and ones that you avoid this is a good question and I feel like my role as a venture capitalist is to add value Beyond just writing a check absolutely I preached that so much about Venture people all the time are like hey can you help me with with meeting a VC I need money it's like it's not enough to need money you need you need what they bring to the relationship because it's a long-term relationship yeah these companies that we invest in will be invested in them for probably more than seven or eight years so we have to be able to do more than that not only that we want to stay relevant for more than that time frame meaning we only we we're investing at this period if they're going to be successful there's going to first eight years of my career were in financial services so naturally I look at a lot of financial services companies fintech companies have a guy on the team who works with a lot of SAS companies because that was his background and then a third guy on the team who does a lot of work with like BTO C companies so we can cover the gamut but categorically it's fintech B2B SAS and some b2c or like Commerce enablement companies these are broad categories but within them the mediums of what each company does is a little bit different but functionally it's like the same thing for example I just got off a call before coming in here with a fintech Founder who was talking about compliance and kyc and all I have no expertise in life sciences so I wouldn't tell a life science founder to do anything right because that's just not my expertise but you know how to get get a hold of experts if you need to absolutely and you know we built a a a a group within Sak Ventures called the Sak Ventures Guild it's 10 people who have expertise in different things and on a quarterly basis we ask our existing portfolio companies and potential portfolio companies to present their company to the entire guild via Zoom tell them what they need and each person on the the call has the opportunity to help that founder with whatever they're looking for right you're also a Tech have uh I'm work working with a fintech Founder now who's building a lending company her name is um the company's called catapult and they're helping CP great name I like that yeah it's a company that's helping cpg Brands to get access to cap working capital to fund their buses a lot of times these cpgs get these massive purchase orders from large retailers but they can't fulfill they can't fulfill it yeah so her company bridges that Gap it's been interesting to work with her on a at first it was a weekly basis now we meet on a bi-weekly basis to talk through the operational challenges the go to market strategy we have good meetings and difficulty in that it's very hard to scale so we can't do that with every single company sure so the guild is important having other team members is important and relying on your network is important as well and organizations that extend your uh Network like like ovf like ovf as well right organizations like them there's even now these companies that are forming where they they'll call you a VC or company and say hey we have a group of experts that charge X number of dollars per hour okay if you'd like to hire any of them to work with any of your startups you can do that too I get a ton of those calls I bet you do but I think it's one of the things where VCS are trying to or people are trying to figure out how to scale VC and add value capital in technically in the first quarter of this year because Sak's a relatively new company I started sarak or Sak in January of last year took the first three months of the year to get the infrastructure built and then spent the remainder of the Year looking for an anchor investor so we did that had our first close in March of this year and now have started formally deploying capital and have a really good pipeline we have a number of companies that were looking at some in Tulsa some here in Oklahoma City uh the first few Investments that we made were based upon companies that had known and have been working with prior to my starting the fact that we're based here in Oklahoma makes the ones here a lot more accessible to us sure but you mentioned earlier the fact that business can be done nationally internationally because of Technology things like that you even mentioned remote work you know Tulsa has a really successful remote work program that is attracting a lot of of talent to Tulsa what what do you what do you think what do you think of that program and how do you think that that effect is going to benefit not just Tulsa but the whole state of Oklahoma probably the Midwest I wish we had that here in Oklahoma City I do too I mean we need a person or organization to step up and do something like that because I think it's been so good for Tulsa and I the it's so much easier for them to sort of live where they want and make really good salary like liveing Tulsa lower cost of living as opposed to Boston or San Francisco or New York or even Austin I do Wonder though Kyle if as some of these tech companies and others who were huge proponents of virtual work and requesting that people come back into the office could that impact negatively Tulsa remote and other programs like that I don't know right but I think that anyone could argue that it's been a great program I wish we had it in Oklahoma City I completely agree too yeah now something we do have in Oklahoma City because it's Statewide and you have a lot of experience with ie you you used to work at i2e so what's what's we seeing at VC in 2024 comes from the fact that it has been around for 20 something years now I would equate i2e in the same way as I would I forgot what that company was called that was the first tech company to receive money from the government in Silicon Valley that effectively started Silicon Valley but it was a group of researchers who you know after World War II they decided to start a tech company with a ton of funding from the government to build Technologies and that was the Genesis of that man if someone REM remembers that the name of that company as a tech person I should know this uh but I is that without ite nothing would exist and uh is a testament to that started with Oklahoma Angel fund one which I created Oklahoma Angel fund two and then obviously planes and now there's a large uh a larger platform of funds that they manage and I'm on I'm a board adviser at i2e management and I have a tremendous amount of respect for the organization I consider them family yeah I there's a huge amount of awesome people over there doing amazing things uh just attended the L's cup award ceremony earlier this week and uh that's another uh application of what they're doing by getting young people in college to to think about entrepreneurism starting businesses and of course hopefully keep those businesses here so more on the traditional side to something more now on Avenger Capital side obviously you it stuck with you because you're still in VC I decided I wanted to get into V to VC in 2006 I'd wrote down my goals I wanted to do this I wasn't sure how and obviously I went from engineering to work at Northwestern Mutual to work at Morgan Stanley then I went to the fed and when I went to the FED I thought to myself man this is so far off from what I want to be doing that how I I get in the Venture from there cuz you know a lot of people would think maybe working at the FED is like would be the the the job right and my job there I was an examiner we would go into Banks and we would look at the loans that these Banks were giving out to make sure they were kosher and I hated that job at first but things and it became almost like a Consulting thing where you're trying to understand the deployment of capital and doesn't make sense and that transferability of that skill set tremendously helped me when I started doing that with private companies because most of the time banks are giving money to private companies so not only that but then the analytical rigor that came along with that was certainly helpful right Scott meum was running ite at the time it just so happens that he and his I think his family owns a bank so when he saw my background he was like Okay Kevin come over here yeah because that's his background right for his family well he's an attorney was a state treasurer he knows numbers Etc Scott's great hope he's enjoying his retirement so you know speaking of it wasn't uh I I don't tell a lot of people this but now I'm pretty open about it but I have a very non-traditional path into Venture professionally but I think a very non-traditional path in general I grew up in Tulsa uh when I was one or two or three my parents moved to Claremore Oklahoma okay my dad was working at a factory there and he was involved with a church my parents split when I was five or six I was in kindergarten and it was tough at that point my mother moved back to Tulsa my father lost his job we were homeless for a couple of years living in this small little shed on the side of our friend's if you want to call it and those were probably the toughest years of my life like I did not envy my childhood and most people who were in those situations didn't turn out like I did right so now that overcome all those obstacles and arrive to where I'm at today with like beautiful wife and two kids and you know just like a normal life I always say you never judge a book by its cover but all the difficulties I experienced sort of made me who I am today and I I think about that quite a bit in regard to even the name of sarak Ventures SARS are these large ice formations that form at the tops of the who are okay with navigate or fighting through these obstacles that they might encounter in Life or in their business because they're just trying to get to the top and we want to help them do that that's sort of our Mantra guiding Founders to the top so for me I can relate to that I love just understanding the story of each founder that we're talking with because I want to understand is this the type of person that will run through a brick wall to be successful cuz I had to do that and most successful people do I I I like the story behind sarak I I I didn't realize what that was I learned a term today and I like that as far as your branding Pro process there uh you also mentioned you know not judging a book by a cover let's talk about your book okay cool yeah you deploy that Capital we had to have 50% match from private investors hence the reason why IE started seed step Angels which was a group of private Angel Investors so I said to Scott meum we should raise our own private fund that way we don't have to go out and sort of her cats to get that other 50% of capital we can just have that inhouse so I took about 18 months to get that going myself and Mark linger we went out into the market and talked to investors for that first fund we raised it was like sub2 million dollar but it was a concept to figure out if this could work that process of trying to get all of that going was so difficult because there was like no one wanted to share information information was hard to come Venture Capital industry of just my Inside Story and the how-to of how to do it at the time I had just started like blogging and I wasn't doing it for any sort of fame or recognition I just thought I've always wanted to be a net contributor to the industry and not be someone that was just taking taking taking so the book my blog things like that were just my way of giving back Well turns out so many people have read that book and thank you for writing this and wrote it deliberately to be short and to the point people have contacted me from all over the world about that book and for me anyone who contacts me and says hey I'd love to talk about how you did that I'm more than game because it was so hard to do that's so cool you that if you're going to talk about something publicly it should be beneficial to the masses yeah one of the things I don't like about social media and even LinkedIn is when it's just a bunch of like look at me I did this I went to this conference this I took this picture I'm like what does that do for me right so my mentality is if I'm going to post it's going to be something of value something where I put some thought into it something to where yes I want my stamp on that I think everybody should do that I I agree totally but not everybody does so you can now understand why I absolutely wanted you on the podcast uh because you bring so much mountain did I do that right so I appreciate you being on podcast I've interview viwed you before for the Oklahoma Venture Forum podcast so I'm now I'm excited that got you on the podcast here uh looking forward to seeing how people react and see maybe what kind of social media interaction we get when we post this episode perfect so appreciate it today we've been talking with Kevin Moore he is a founder of sarak Ventures which is a GP he a general partner there he is a background in finance and all types of things that go around business and he is someone who has made it to the top of the mountain despite that sck trying to hold him back appreciate you being on the podcast today Kevin thank you Kyle love it appreciate you thank you for listening to the golden group strategic growth podcast"

        "full_transcript": "see Founders that become VCS uh we see VCS that become Founders uh in your case you an LP and then you ended up becoming a VC so the skill sets and like that knowledge that you that wisdom that you have evaluating Founders I mean and fund managers especially um that really arms you to know how to profile um you know building relationships with institutions right because you kind of know how they think so I think that's definitely an edge that you would have that a typical emerging manager starting from zero would would not have so I think that's definitely um a helpful thing in your tool belt you and that goes back to the range right kind of moving around to different um Industries so yeah I think you've invested in funds you know you understand the public markets so again I'm very very thankful and humbled to have the opportunity to do what I'm doing because and I appreciate that it's hard I appreciate you know the importance of what we do I mean to have the opportunity to in invest in a Founder who's trying to build their dreams and help them to achieve that that's a very rewarding feeling my wife she works in corporate recruiting she's a manager but she said the joy of giving someone a job that changes their life to build something and you got to respect that hustle that grind so I just it just baffles my mind when I read these stories where VCS are mean to Founders I'm just like they're going through it you have to empathize with that I just I just don't I just cannot register being mean to entrepreneur just doesn't make any sense to me yeah yeah I mean I totally agree it's different personalities and and um you know I think the ones that are long on relationships I mean I've seen Founders later become institutional LPS so my only response to that is like it's a small world and it's you know those you never you know you never know where people can you know end up I mean they was teaching like 15 years later and this person was like my my student and I was like man I should fail this person but I didn't um but you know so I think it's it's a small world and I think that if you have the opportunity to get revenge um look the best revenge is just doing well in your in your career and and and uh and just being successful that's like the most bitter Revenge you can get you're not going to get anything with um you know just doing something spiteful but just be successful and and be on top of the news feet for all those great things I feel I remember a story of a Founder who I was working with at i2e and everyone loved his technology and everything was was like yeah that looks good that's good then we got to valuation and it was far lower than what he wanted justifiably I mean had no product no revenues like pre and he lost it he started cussing us out he was being really mean and both myself and the president we were just like eyebrows raised like what is happening right now anyway needless to say we did not do that deal yeah but it was a great learning experience to be like yeah is this someone you want to work with for the next five seven years imagine like the liability that you'd have to deal with over the years you know just um dealing with those outbursts and and just other people too yeah I mean I I mentioned this you know I was on a panel yesterday and I mentioned this I mean I I think when times are tough you start to see a lot of people uh be a lot more on edge so everybody's raising right Founders are trying to raise fund managers are you know having trouble closing their fun so you start to see some true colors of some people in these tough times and they have outbursts like that you know and I think the it goes back to the basics of what like you learned in you know we we learn learned in our sales skills it's really just business development 10one you know it's even if you got to go old school and Shake somebody's hand you know smile uh say their name you know remember their they're not it's not out of style to really know a person's life and really uh build a relationship with them but I think a lot of us were you know we're in the Tinder generation where you know you meet well I Shar that story because it was the reverse of someone being mean to the investor it's just like now if I ever hear another investor who comes across that person they've just burnt so many britches so I guess that was the point there but I agree you know the the relationship side of this is so important and you know I won't stress enough that you know LPS you meet today might be LPS four or five years from now you know treating even treating even the the students has an uncle or cousin or something just in the professional Community who I had a an investor call with them I was talking about the company he was like oh by the way my nephew or cousin was in this class that you spoke in and he was telling me about you and how nice you were to them and all the different things he like that's pretty awesome to see how something that seemed completely disconnected to something else ended up being this connection that potentially could be beneficial for the firm that happened to me with the job yeah like I mean I was teaching this I was like an adjunct teacher for like this tech school and um market for a new job and he put in a good word for me and I mean that person pretty much saved my career um that is awesome yeah I mean so it just you really got to be nice to everybody and you can get an edge just from doing that so well I uh yeah that's sort of"
